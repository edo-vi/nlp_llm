    "Consider a document $d$. We can represent it as a sequence of tokens $(t_1,\\dotsc, t_n)$, for $n$ indexes, $1$ to $n$. For each document whose size $|d|$ is greater than the context window size $\\tau$, the problem consists in finding $m$ indexes $s_1, \\dotsc, s_m$ s.t. $s_i < s_j$ for $i < j$, and such that the resulting \"slices\" (really, documents) $d_1 = (t_1, \\dotsc, s_1), d_2 = (s_1 +1, \\dotsc, s_2), \\dotsc, d_{m+1} = (s_m +1, \\dotsc, t_n)$ have all sizes smaller than $\\tau$ and such that the distance $D(d_i, d_{i+1})$ for $i = 1,\\dotsc,m$ is greater than another given threshold $\\ell$. Concretely, in our case we have $\\tau$ equal to the LLM (Llama) context window size, and $\\ell = 0.2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, this is, in general, a hard problem: $m$ is not given and each slice index can take up to $n$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of an inefficient implementation of this optimization problem (that would require looking through lots of values for $m$ and for each of the slice indexes) I have implemented an efficient slicing method based on a recursive partitioning of the document, similar to how Decision Trees work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "It starts with dividing the given document exactly in half, if it's actually larger than the context window size (otherwise, it just returns the whole document as a single slice). \n",
    "Then, for each slice, it recursively applies the same procedure, splitting them in half. This continues until all the resulting slices are smaller than the context window size. Now, the algorithm computes the distances between all consecutive slices. If some slices are too close to each other, it splits again both (going from 2 slices to 4, that are of course guaranteed to be smaller than the context window size), and the process is repeated from the distance computation point onward, until all slices are distant enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works due to the insight that, in general, smaller slices are more diverse than larger slices. I will empirically validate this insight in a short moment. For now, consider the following example: a document with text \"Dì sempre questo: dì sempre questo\". Splitting it in half will yeld two slices with distance 0: \"Dì sempre questo | dì sempre questo\" which cannot be accepted. Therefore, the algorithm would resplit the two slices, obtaining: \"Dì sempre | questo | dì sempre | questo\" (assuming it rounds up the slicing index). All the consecutive slices have now distance 1 and the slices are accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, the slices will be more distant. There is however the problem of convergence: does the algorithm always end by returning slices that are different and small enough? No, if we allow documents to have identical consecutive tokens. This because, in the worst case, each token of the document will correspond to one slice, and if we have two identical consecutive token then it will return slices with distance 0 that cannot be splitted anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "My code avoids this problem at the source: when a document is parsed, consecutive tokens are merged together like this: \"same same same different\" -> \"same_same_same different\" (check the Document class __init__ method). This guarantee that the procedure will end with slices that are distant enough, because, if we reach the worst case, all slices will have distance 1. "
