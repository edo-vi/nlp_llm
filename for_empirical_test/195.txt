Antigenic escape immune escape immune evasion or escape mutation occurs when the immune system of a Host (biology)
Different antigens are able to escape through a variety of mechanisms For example the African Trypanosoma
Antigenic escape is not only crucial for the hosts natural immune response but also for the resistance against vaccinations The problem of antigenic escape has greatly deterred the process of creating new vaccines Because vaccines generally cover a small ratio of strains of one virus the recombination of antigenic DNA that lead to diverse pathogens allows these invaders to resist even newly developed vaccinations Some antigens may even target pathways different from those the vaccine had originally intended to target

 Mechanisms of evasion 

 Helicobacter pylori and homologous recombination 
The most common of antigenic escape mechanisms homologous recombination can be seen in a wide variety of bacterial pathogens including Helicobacter pylori a bacterium that infects the human stomach While a hosts homologous recombination can act as a defense mechanisms for fixing DNA repairDoublestrand breaks
 African trypanosomes 
African trypanosomes are parasites that are able to escape the immune responses of its host animal through a range of mechanisms Its most prevalent mechanism is its ability to evade recognition by antibodies through antigenic variation This is achieved through the switching of its variant surface glycoprotein or VSG a substance that coats the entire antigen When this coat is recognized by an antibody the parasite can be eliminated However variation of this coat can lead to antibodies being unable to recognize and eliminate the antigen In addition to this the VSG coat is able to clear the antibodies themselves to escape their clearing function

Trypanosomes are also able to achieve evasion through the mediation of the hosts immune response Through the conversion of adenosine triphosphate
 Plant RNA viruses 
Lafforgue et al 2011 found escape mutants in plant RNA viruses to be encouraged by coexistence of transgenic crops with artificial microRNA
 Tumor escape 
Many head and neck cancers are able to escape immune responses in a variety of ways One such example is through the production of proinflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines This can be achieved when the tumor recruits immunosuppressive cell subsets into the tumors environment Such cells include protumor M2 macrophages myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSCs) Th2 polarized T helper cell
 Escape from vaccination 

 Consequences of recent vaccines 
While vaccines are created to strengthen the immune response to pathogens in many cases these vaccines are not able to cover the wide variety of strains a pathogen may have Instead they may only protect against one or two strains leading to the escape of strains not covered by the vaccine This results in the pathogens being able to attack targets of the immune system different than those intended to be targeted by the vaccination This parasitic antigen diversity is particularly troublesome for the development of the malaria vaccines

 Solutions to escape of vaccination 
In order to fix this problem vaccines must be able to cover the wide variety of strains within a bacterial population In recent research of Neisseria meningitidis the possibility of such broad coverage may be achieved through the combination of multicomponent polysaccharide conjugate vaccines However in order to further improve upon broadening the scope of vaccinations epidemiological surveillance must be conducted to better detect the variation of escape mutants and their spread
