Enzootic is the nonhuman equivalent of Endemic (epidemiology)
It also has two specific meanings:

 an organism being "enzootic" means native to a place or a specific fauna
 in epizoology an infection is said to be "enzootic" in a population when the infection is maintained in the population without the need for external inputs (cf Endemic (epidemiology)
