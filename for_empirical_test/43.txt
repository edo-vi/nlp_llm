For many decades after the end of the Second World War the Jewish past and the events of the Nazi era received little attention from the side of the club until 2011 when the book Der FC Bayern und seine Juden (FC Bayern and their Jews) was published and renewed interest Until then the club for various reasons had been reluctant to address its own history during the Nazi era

FK Austria Wien
FK Austria Wien based in Vienna had from its formation been led and influenced by Jewish citizens The club experienced little antisemitic behaviour until the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany in March 1938 but this radically changed from then on After the Anschluss Austria was forced to change its name for a time to SC Ostmark having to evict all its Jewish members and experiencing only limited amount of success in the Gauliga Ostmark during the time Austria Wiens Jewish president  escaped Nazi Germany like Bayern Munichs Kurt Landauer but had a much more difficult time evading arrest and like Landauer led his club once more after the Second World War
