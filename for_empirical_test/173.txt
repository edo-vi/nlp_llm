The rally was criticised before 2000 for crossing through the List of territorial disputes
The environmental impact of the race has been another area of criticism This criticism of the race is the topic of the song "500 connards sur la ligne de départ" ("500 Arseholes at the Starting Line") on the 1991 album Marchand de cailloux by French singer Renaud In 2014 the Dakar rally was criticized for damage done to archaeological sites in Chile
