Sessility is the biology
Sessile organisms can move via external forces (such as water currents) but are usually permanently attached to something. Organisms such as corals lay down their own substrate (biology)
Mobility
Sessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. Sponges have a motile larval stage and become sessile at maturity. Conversely many jellyfish develop as sessile polyp (zoology)
Reproduction
Many sessile animals including sponges corals and hydra (genus)
Clumping

Clumping is a behavior in sessile organisms in which individuals of a particular species group closely to one another for beneficial purposes as can be seen in coral reefs and cochineal populations. This allows for faster reproduction and better protection from predators.
