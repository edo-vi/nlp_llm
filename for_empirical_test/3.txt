 Equine herpesvirus 2


Equid gammaherpesvirus 2 formerly Equine herpesvirus 2 (EHV2) is a virus of the family Herpesviridae originally known as equine cytomegalovirus due to its slow replication in tissue culture  However complete sequencing of the EHV2 genome has demonstrated that it is a member of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae in the genus Percavirus
