Image:Ausopen margaret court arena mediumjpgThe Extreme Heat Policy is a rule pertaining to the Australian Open (tennis) It was introduced in 1998 after consultation with a number of tennis players Its current iteration was first implemented in 2019 and uses a scale of 1 to 5 that accounts for the physiological variances between adults wheelchair and junior athletes while also taking into account the four climate factors – air temperature radiant heat or the strength of the sun humidity and wind speed – which affect a player’s ability to disperse heat from their body

Changes for 2015

Following severe criticism of the handling of the 2014 Australian Open organisers increased the temperature threshold from the 2003 level of  and increased the wetbulb globe temperature (WBGT) threshold from the 2003 level of  to allow for more continuous play and fewer stoppages in the future

WBGT charts show that the new threshold may not be triggered even if the temperature reaches  when there is no humidity

When the policy is implemented matches will now be halted after an even number of games in the set rather than at the conclusion of the set

There will also be a retractable roof available on Margaret Court Arena for the first time

History
In 1988 Rod Laver Arena opened making the Australian Open the first Grand Slam to feature a retractable roof The initial heat policy allowed for the roof to be closed when the temperature rose above  or at the referees discretion when the temperature rose above  but only for daytime matches and only once all singles matches could be scheduled inside Rod Laver Arena This effectively meant that the heat policy could only go in effect in the quarterfinals or later in the tournament

Officials considered closing the roof for the final in 1993 due to a temperature of  but Jim Courier threatened to boycott the match unless the roof remained open

The heat rule was first invoked during the quarterfinal round in 1997

In 1998 a new policy was implemented calling for play on all courts to be stopped if the temperature reached  This was later changed in 2002 to 

The 2002 womens final was played in  heat which triggered a 10minute break between the 2nd and 3rd sets but no halt in play

Beginning with the 2003 tournament the policy was changed to  and a WBGT of 

The new policy was invoked on January 20 2003 on a day when the temperature reached  and the WBGT reached the  mark Play was halted for the minimum 2 hours

After the extreme heat policy was invoked in consecutive years in 2006 and 2007 the policy was again changed starting in 2008 to allow matches in progress to be halted at the conclusion of the set  Prior to that a match already underway had to be completed  The policy was further changed in 2008 to allow play to be stopped only at the discretion of the tournament referee rather than relying solely on temperature and WBGT calculations

The policy was invoked several times in 2009 the hottest tournament to date with an average temperature of 

The policy was invoked on day 2 of the 2023 tournament was temperatures reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit with a feel of 101 degrees Fahrenheit Play was suspended on all courts that did not have a roof

Criticism
2014
The extreme heat policy came under criticism during the 2014 Australian Open after ballboys attendants in the stands and players were suffering various heatrelated illnesses due to four consecutive days with highs between  but organizers claimed the humidity remained low enough on all but one day for the policy not to be enforced; tournament referee Wayne McKewen said that "While conditions were hot and uncomfortable the relatively low level of humidity ensured that conditions never deteriorated to a point where it was necessary to invoke the extreme heat policy" Frank Dancevic who began to hallucinate and collapse during his 6–7<sup>(12–14)</sup> 3–6 4–6 loss to Benoît Paire described the conditions as "inhumane" while severely criticising the policy and Andy Murray voiced his concerns about peoples safety stating that "it only takes one bad thing to happen" Ivan Dodig who also collapsed and was forced to retire said afterwards that he feared he might die in the extreme conditions Nine players retired during the second day while Daniel GimenoTraver carried off a ball boy who fainted during his match and Peng Shuai was amongst many throughout the tournament that required medical attention JoWilfried Tsonga and Caroline Wozniacki noted that their shoes and water bottles were beginning to melt in the conditions while Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka said that the heat was affecting their play

Roger Federer however agreed with the referees decision saying that adequate training and preparation should be enough to cope with the weather Gilles Simon who was injured prior to the tournament took a similar view and said that the heat improved his game

On the second day of the tournament the temperature reached   On the third day it reached   On the fourth day it reached   On the fifth day it reached  with 6% humidity  Play continued uninterrupted for the second third and fifth days and was stopped for 4 hours on the fourth day  For many players the stoppage was closer to 3 hours because they had to complete the set in progress even after the policy went into effect  On Rod Laver Arena Maria Sharapova and Karin Knapp had to complete a 3rd set that lasted nearly 2 hours and 18 games  On the third day 970 fans had been treated for heat exhaustion

While the exact WBGT on these days has not been revealed by the organizers it is clear that had the earlier 1998 policy been still in effect play would have been halted all 4 days once the temperature exceeded 40 degrees Celsius

The extreme heat resulted in a record number of 9 withdraws in the first round

Spectator lawsuit
On January 24 2015 the Herald Sun reported that Susan Carman sued the Melbourne & Olympic Parks Trust for failing to close the roof at Hisense Arena during Andy Murrays second round match in the 2013 Australian Open The temperature that day reached  Carman says she fell down the stairs while seeking shade
