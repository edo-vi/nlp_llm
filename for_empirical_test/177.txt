 is a 2004 Japanese anime music video created for the popular NHK program Minna no Uta by director Atsuko Ishizuka and Madhouse (company)
Production
Minna no Uta a showcase for independent Japanese animators and musicians presented on the public broadcasting network NHK had taken notice of Atsuko Ishizuka while she was still in college Initially a student of graphic design Ishizuka had taken to animation and produced several short films entirely on her own before being hired by Madhouse It was shortly after being hired that Minna no Uta contacted her to direct a music video for their program Convinced by the Minna no Uta staff Madhouse promoted the lowranking Ishizuka (then a production assistant) to director and lent the studios resources to the production

After production was completed the music video was shown on Minna no Uta broadcasts from the beginning of October through November 2004 Its success later prompted NHK to order another short from Ishizuka and Madhouse Sen no Hana Sen no Sora in 2005

Animation Style
The film is animated in Ishizukas "moving sketch" style giving the short the look of a hand drawn and colored pencil work The animation and designs are not smooth or cleaned up giving them a rougher feel This is stylistic continuation of Ishizukas earlier solo works CREMONA and Gravitation and has traditionally been a style more often seen in independent world animation rather than studioproduced anime The animation itself was done by Madhouse veteran Yoshinori Kanemori Despite the appearance Tsuki no Waltz was done in much the same way as Madhouses normal anime using the technique of digital ink & paint for the coloring Great care was taken to disguise and cover these modern productions aids and ensure that the film look as handcrafted and individual to Ishizukas style as possible

Music

Reception
According to Benjamin Ettinger of AniPages Daily Ishizuka received "literally thousands of posts on the BBS at her home page" after Tsuki no Waltz was aired Ettinger himself called the film "probably among the best pieces made for the show Minna no Uta in the last few years" The film was also popular enough to receive a home video release
