A literary feud is a conflict or quarrel between wellknown writers usually conducted in public view by way of published letters speeches lectures and interviews In the book Literary Feuds Anthony Arthur (author)
Feuds were sometimes based on conflicting views of the nature of literature as between C P Snow and F R Leavis
History of literary feuds

A literary feud involves both a public forum and public reprisals Feuds might begin in the public view through the quarterlies newspapers and monthly magazines but frequently extended into private correspondence and inperson meetings The participants are literary figures: writers poets playwrights critics Many feuds were based on opposing philosophies of literature art and social issues although the disputes often devolved into attacks on personality and character Feuds often have personal political commercial and ideological dimensions

In Laphams Quarterly Hua Hsu compares literary feuds with the oneupmanship of hiphop artists "animatedby antipathy insecurity jealousy" and notes that "Some of the great literary feuds of the past would have been perfect for the social media age given their withering brevity" It is not uncommon for observers particularly the press to label writers rivalries and deteriorations in friendships as feuds such as the rivalry between sisters A S Byatt and Margaret Drabble or when Mario Vargas LlosaFile:LordJeffreyjpgDuring the Romanticism
Coleridge described the Romantic era as "the age of personality" in which the public is preoccupied with the private lives of people in the public eye and accuses the periodicals of the time of having "a habit of malignity" In footnotes to his Biographia Literaria Coleridge made accusations against Jeffrey without naming him but providing sufficient detail that others would easily know the person he meant Through his responses Jeffrey "magnifies a footnote into a feud" going so far as to sign his initials to his rebuttals despite the commonly accepted culture of reviewer anonymity at the time Coleridge complained that media attention to his quarrel with the Edinburgh editor left him unable to escape from "the degrading Taste of the present Public for personal Gossip" The British Critic weighed in siding with Coleridge while Blackwoods launched its own attack on the poet

Just as attacks could take the form of "persecution by association" in which a writer might be maligned for an actual or perceived allegiance to another writer reprisals could bring in more participants to engage in "selfdefense by association" Scholar John Sloan says of the late 19th century writers "In the age of mass culture and the popular press public rowing was regarded as a favourite device for the attentionseekers whose wish was to astonish and arrive"

Dr Manfred Weidhorn the Abraham and Irene Guterman Chair in English Literature and professor emeritus of English at Yeshiva University says "At least one such major confrontation appears in a different country during each of the traditional major phases of Western culture — classical Greece medieval Germany Renaissance England Age of Enlightenment
Classical Greece

In classical Greece poets and playwrights competed at festivals such as City Dionysia and Lenaia Weidhorn cites a conflict between Euripides and Sophocles as evidenced by the line in Aristotles Poetics "Sophocles said that he himself created characters such as should exist whereas Euripides created ones such as actually do exist" Aristophanes notably caricatured Euripides in his plays Centuries later George Bernard Shaw and John Davidson (poet)
Medieval German

In medieval Germany Gottfried von Strassburgs Tristan and Wolfram von Eschenbachs Parzival which were published at the same time differed on social esthetic and moral viewpoints and resulted in what has been called "one of the more famous literary quarrels in medieval literature" although that characterization based on interpretations of fragments has been disputed by other scholars

Renaissance England

For a major confrontation in Renaissance England Weidhorn posits Shakespeare versus Ben Jonson referring to the War of the Theatres also known as the Poetomachia Scholars differ over the true nature and extent of the rivalry behind the Poetomachia Some have seen it as a competition between theatre companies rather than individual writers though this is a minority view It has even been suggested that the playwrights involved had no serious rivalry and even admired each other and that the "War" was a selfpromotional publicity stunt a "planned  quarrel to advertise each other as literary figures and for profit" Most critics see the Poetomachia as a mixture of personal rivalries and serious artistic concerns—"a vehicle for aggressively expressing differencesin literary theorya basic philosophical debate on the status of literary and dramatic authorship"

Enlightenment France and England

The conflict between Voltaire and Rousseau in France would erupt whenever either of them published a major work beginning with Voltaires criticisms to Rousseaus Discourse on Inequality When Voltaire published Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne (English title: Poem on the Lisbon Disaster) Rousseau felt the poem "exaggerated mans misery and turned God into a malevolent being" Their various disagreements escalated to Rousseau revealing that Voltaire was the author of a pamphlet Voltaire had published anonymously to avoid arrest
File:ShamelajpgIn England Henry Fieldings novel Pamela; or Virtue Rewarded and Samuel Richardsons novel Shamela posed opposing views on the purpose of novels and how realism and morals should be reflected A portion of the subtitle to Shamela was In which the many notorious Falsehoods and Misrepresentations of a Book called Pamela are exposed and refuted Literary critic Michael LaPointe suggests that Fieldings Shamela in response to Richardsons Pamela represents an exemplary literary feud: "a serious argument about the nature of literature that takes place actually within the literary medium"

A wider ranging literary quarrel became known as the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns In France at the end of the seventeenth century a minor furor arose over the question of whether contemporary learning had surpassed what was known by those in Classical Greece and Rome The "moderns" (epitomised by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle) took the position that the modern age of science and reason was superior to the superstitious and limited world of Greece and Rome In Fontenelles opinion modern man saw farther than the ancients ever could The "ancients" for their part argued that all that is necessary to be known was to be found in Virgil Cicero Homer and especially Aristotle The dispute was satirized by Jonathan Swift in The Battle of the Books

Nineteenthcentury Russia

Both Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky were respected writers in Russia and initially thought well of each others work Then Dostoyevsky objected to War and Peace being referred to as an "act of genius" saying Pushkin was the real genius The writers had opposing views during RussoTurkish War (1877–1878)
Modern America

Although Faulkner and Hemingway respected each others work Faulkner told a group of college students that he ranked himself higher than Hemingway among American writers because Hemingway was "too careful too afraid of making mistakes in diction; he lacked courage" Faulkners remarks were leaked and published in a New York newspaper infuriating Hemingway Especially troubled by the comments on his courage Hemingway requested a letter from an Army general to attest to Hemingways bravery Although Faulkner apologized in a letter he would continue to make similar statements about Hemingway as a writer Their disputes continued over the years with Faulkner refusing to review The Old Man and the Sea with what Hemingway took as a vicious insult and Hemingway saying A Fable was "false and contrived"

Notable feuds
 Germain de Brie and Thomas More 
Germain de Bries most famous work was Chordigerae navis conflagratio ("The Burning of the Ship Cordelière") (1512) a Latin poem about the recent destruction of the Breton flagship Cordelière in the Battle of SaintMathieu between the French and English fleets The poem led to a literary controversy with the English scholar and statesman Sir Thomas More in part because it contained criticisms of English leaders but also because of its hyperbolic account of the bravery of the Breton captain Hervé de Portzmoguer In his epigrams addressed to de Brie More ridiculed the poems description of "Hervé fighting indiscriminately with four weapons and a shield; perhaps the fact slipped your mind but your reader ought to have been informed in advance that Hervé had five hands 

Stung by Mores attacks de Brie wrote an aggressive reply the Latin verse satire Antimorus (1519) including an appendix which contained a "pagebypage listing of the mistakes in Mores poems" Sir Thomas immediately wrote another hardhitting pamphlet Letter against Brixius but Erasmus intervened to calm the situation and persuaded More to stop the sale of the publication and let the matter drop

Thomas Nashe and Gabriel Harvey
The feud between Thomas Nashe and Gabriel Harvey was conducted through pamphlet wars in 16th century England and was so well known that Shakespeares play Loves Labours Lost included references to the quarrel

In 1590 Gabriels brother Richard criticized Nashe in his work The Lamb of God
In 1592 Robert Greene (dramatist)Nashe attacked Richard Harvey in Pierce Penniless writing "Would you in likely reason gesse it were possible for any shameswolne toad to have the spetproofe face to out live this disgrace?"
Gabriel Harvey responded to Greene in Four Letters and in it criticized Nashe to defend his brother
Nashe responded with Strange News of Intercepting Certain Letters attacking Gabriel at length
Gabriel Harvey wrote Pierces Supererogation however before it is published Nashe published a letter to Christs Tears apologizing to Harvey
Gabriel Harvey responded with A New Letter of Notable Content rejecting reconciliation with Nashe
Nashe revised his letter to Christs Tears to respond angrily then wrote a fuller response in Have with You to Saffron Walden in 1597 in which he claimed to continue the quarrel to salvage his own reputation
In 1599 Archbishop Whitgift and Richard Bancroft bishop of London banned all works by Nashe and Harvey in an order against satiric and contentious publications

Although it began as a controversy between factions of writers it became a personal quarrel between Nash and Gabriel Harvey after John Harvey and Robert Greene both died and Richard Harvey withdrew from participation There is some speculation that the controversy was encouraged to sell more books

Molière and Edmé Boursault
File:Moliére 1jpgThe play Portrait of the Painter or Criticisms of the School for Women Criticized (French: Le Portrait du Peintre ou La Contrecritique de L’École des femmes September 1663) by Edmé Boursault was part of an ongoing literary quarrel over The School for Wives (1662) by Molière

The original play had caricatured "maledominated exploitative marital relationships" and became a target of criticism Criticisms ranged from accusing Molière of impiety to nitpicking over the perceived lack of realism in certain scenes Molière had answered his critics with a second play The School for Women Criticized (French: La Critique de L’École des femmes June 1663)

Boursault wrote his play in answer to this second play In The School for Women Criticized Molière poked fun at his critics by having their arguments expressed on stage by comical fools while the character defending the original play a mouthpiece for the writer is a straight man with serious and thoughtful replies In his Portrait Boursault imitates the structure of Molières play but subjects the characters to a role reversal In other words the critics of Molière are featured as serious and his defenders as fools Boursault probably included other malicious and personal attacks on Molière and his associates in the stage version which were edited out in time for publication The modern scholar can only guess at their nature by Molières haste to respond

Molière answered with a third play of his own The Versailles Impromptu (French: LImpromptu de Versailles October 1663) which reportedly took him only eight days to write It went on stage two weeks (or less) after the Portrait This play takes place in the theatrical world featuring actors playing actors on stage Among jests aimed at various targets Molière mocks Boursault for his obscurity The characters have trouble even remembering the name of someone called "Brossaut" Molière further taunts the upstart as "a publicityseeking hack"

Alexander Pope and John Hervey

John Hervey 2nd Baron Hervey
Popes reply was a Letter to a Noble Lord dated November 1733 and the portrait of Sporus in the Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot (1743) which forms the prologue to the satires Many of the insinuations and insults contained in it are borrowed from Pulteneys A Proper Reply to a late Scurrilous Libel

Ugo Foscolo and Urbano Lampredi

In 1810 Ugo Foscolo wrote a satirical essay Ragguaglio dunadunanza dellAccademia de Pitagorici that mocked a group of Milanese literary figures One of those figures Urbano Lampredi responded harshly in the literary journal Corriere Milanese Foscolos response called Lampredi "King of the league of literary charlatans" The dispute extended to the Il Poligrafo and Annali di scienze e lettere journals

Lord Byron and John Keats
Lord Byron disdained the poetry of John Keats the son of a liverystable keeper calling Keats a "Cockney poet" and referring to "Johnny Keats pissabed poetry" In turn Keats claimed the success of Bryons work was due more to his pedigree and appearance than any merit

Charles Dickens Edmund Yates and W M Thackeray
In the 1850s Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray were considered competitors for novelist of the era They were not friends and it was well known among their fellow members of the Garrick Club that should one enter the room the other would quickly make excuses and leave

In 1858 Dickens and his wife were separating He was made aware that Thackeray had commented to a third party that Dickenss marital discord was due to an actress Edmund Yates a friend of Dickens published an unflattering profile of Thackeray in Town Talk Thackeray accused Yates of writing a piece that was "slanderous and untrue" but Yates refused to apologize and replied that Thackerays letter was the "slanderous and untrue document"

Thackeray requested that the Garrick Club take action against Yates for behaviour "intolerable in a Society of Gentlemen" The club leadership demanded that Yates apologize or quit the club; Yates refused to do either and threatened to hire a barrister Dickens offered to mediate the disagreement which Thackeray refused In describing his quarrel with Yates Thackeray said "I am hitting the man behind him" referring to Dickens

William Dean Howells and Edmund Stedman
In 1886 William Dean Howells and Edmund Stedman traded verbal blows in the pages of Harpers Monthly and the New Princeton Review Their disagreements on the origins of literary craftsmanship and the limits of historical knowledge were reported on by other periodicals such as The Critic the Boston Gazette and the Penny Post The conflict stemmed from Howells promotion of literary realism against Stedmans defense of idealism

Marcel Proust and Jean Lorrain

Jean Lorrain wrote an unfavorable review of Marcel Prousts Pleasures and Days in which he insinuated that Proust was having an affair with Lucien Daudet Proust challenged Lorrain to a duel The two writers exchanged shots from twentyfive paces on 5 February 1897 and neither was hit by a bullet

Mark Twain and Bret Harte
File:Bret Harte and Mark TwainjpgMark Twain and Bret Harte both popular American writers in the nineteenth century were colleagues friends and competitors Harte as the editor of a magazine called Overland Monthly "trimmed and trained and schooled" Twain into becoming a better writer as Twain put it In late 1876 Twain and Harte agreed to collaborate on a play Ah Sin that featured the character Hop Sing from Hartes earlier play Two Men of Sandy Bar Neither writer was satisfied with the script that resulted and both of them were dealing with other difficulties in their lives at the time: Harte with financial troubles and drinking and Twain with his Huckleberry Finn manuscript The biographer Marilyn Duckett dates the estrangement between Harte and Twain to their letters in 1877 when Twain suggested that he hire Harte to work on another play with him for $25 a week (rather than lend him any money) and Harte reacted with outrage Harte also held Twain responsible for recommending a publisher who would then mishandle Hartes novel and declared that because of the financial losses that resulted he need not repay Twain money he had previously borrowed Twain described Hartes letter as "ineffable "

Twain reworked Ah Sin without Harte and it opened on Broadway in July although it was not a success The final direct communication between the two writers was a telegram from Harte asking for his share of the box office receipts

When some influential friends recommended Harte to thenPresident Rutherford B Hayes for a diplomatic post Twain contacted William Dean Howells who was related by marriage to the President to work against any such appointment claiming that Harte would disgrace the nation Twains letter included "Wherever he goes his wake is tumultuous with swindled grocers & with defrauded innocents who have loaned him moneyNo man who has ever known him respects him" However Harte would eventually win an appointment to Germany

As Twains fame as a writer grew and Hartes faded Twain continued to comment on Hartes work and character including the suggestion that Harte was homosexual Even several years after Hartes death in Twains reminiscences which were published as Mark Twain in Eruption Twain included derisive comments about Harte: "He hadnt any more passion for his country than an oyster has for its bed; in fact not so much and I apologize to the oyster"

Edgar Allan Poe and Thomas Dunn English
Thomas Dunn English was a friend of author Edgar Allan Poe but the two fell out amidst a public scandal involving Poe and the writers Frances Sargent Osgood and Elizabeth F Ellet After suggestions that her letters to Poe contained indiscreet material Ellet asked her brother to demand the return of the letters Poe who claimed he had already returned the letters asked English for a pistol to defend himself from Ellets infuriated brother English was skeptical of Poes story and suggested that he end the scandal by retracting the "unfounded charges" against Ellet The angry Poe pushed English into a fistfight during which his face was cut by Englishs ring Poe later claimed to have given English "a flogging which he will remember to the day of his death" though English denied it; either way the fight ended their friendship and stoked further gossip about the scandal

Later that year Poe harshly criticized Englishs work as part of his "Literati of New York" series published in Godeys Ladys Book referring to him as "a man without the commonest school education busying himself in attempts to instruct mankind in topics of literature" The two had several confrontations usually centered around literary caricatures of one another One of Englishs letters which was published in the 23 July 1846 issue of the New York Mirror caused Poe to successfully sue the editors of the Mirror for defamation
Edgar Allan Poe and Rufus Wilmot Griswold
The writer Rufus Wilmot Griswold first met Poe in Philadelphia in May 1841 while working for the Daily Standard In a letter dated 29 March 1841 Poe sent Griswold several poems for The Poets and Poetry of America anthology writing that he would be proud to see "one or two of them in the book" Griswold included three of these poems: "Coliseum" "The Haunted Palace (poem)
Making the relationship even more strained only months later Griswold was hired by George Rex Graham to take up Poes former position as editor of Grahams Magazine Griswold however was paid more and given more editorial control of the magazine than Poe Shortly after Poe began presenting a series of lectures called "The Poets and Poetry of America" Poe openly attacked Griswold in front of his large audience and continued to do so in similar lectures Another source of animosity between the two men was their competition for the attention of the poet Frances Sargent Osgood in the mid to late 1840s


After Death of Edgar Allan Poe
Griswold claimed that "among the last requests of Mr Poe" was that he become his literary executor "for the benefit of his family" Griswold along with James Russell Lowell and Nathaniel Parker Willis edited a posthumous collection of Poes works published in three volumes starting in January 1850 He did not share the profits of his edition with Poes surviving relatives This edition included a biographical sketch titled "Memoir of the Author" which has become notorious for its inaccuracy The "Memoir" depicts Poe as a madman addicted to drugs and chronically drunk Many elements were fabricated by Griswold using forged letters as evidence and it was denounced by those who knew Poe including Sarah Helen Whitman Charles Frederick Briggs and George Rex Graham Some of the information that Griswold asserted or implied was that Poe was expelled from the University of Virginia and that Poe had tried to seduce his guardian John Allans second wife Griswolds characterization of Poe and the false information he originated appeared consistently in Poe biographies for the next two decades

Virginia Woolf and Arnold Bennett
File:Virginia Woolf 1927jpgArnold Bennett wrote an article called "Is the Novel Decaying?" in 1923 in which as an example he criticized Virginia Woolfs characterizations in Jacobs Room Woolf responded with "Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown" in the Nation and Athenaeum In her piece Woolf misquoted Bennetts article and displayed ill temper She then significantly rewrote "Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown" "to ridicule patronize and actually distort Bennetts writing without raising her voice"

Though he didnt respond immediately Bennett later began an antiWoolf campaign in a weekly column in the Evening Standard giving negative reviews of three of Woolfs novels His reviews continued the attack on Woolfs characterizations saying "Mrs Woolf (in my opinion) told us ten thousand things about Mrs Dalloway but did not show us Mrs Dalloway" His essay "The Progress of the Novel" for the journal The Realist (British magazine)
Although the two writers met socially and acted with civility each recorded the meetings harshly in their respective journals On Bennetts death Woolf wrote in her diary ""Queer how one regrets the dispersal of anybody who seemed—as I say—genuine; who had direct contact with life—for he abused me; and I yet rather wished him to go on abusing me; and me abusing him"


Vladimir Nabokov and Edmund Wilson
The feud between Vladimir Nabokov and Edmund Wilson began in 1965 After a twentyfiveyear friendship which was at times strained due to Nabokovs disdain for Wilsons political views and then later by Wilsons criticism of Lolita the two writers ultimately fell out over the translation of Alexander Pushkins Eugene Onegin

In 1964 Nabokov published his translation of the Russian classic which he felt conformed scrupulously to the sense of the poem while completely eschewing melody and rhyme Wilsons review of Nabokovs translation in the New York Review of Books was cutting and disparaging In his book The Feud Alex Beam describes Wilsons review as "an overlong spiteful stochastically accurate generally useless but unfailingly amusing hatchet job"

Rejoinders and rebuttals spread from New York Review to Encounter (magazine)
Years later hearing that Wilson was ill Nabokov wrote to him saying that he no longer held a "grudge for your incomprehensible incomprehension of Pushkins and Nabokovs Onegin"

Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal

In 1971 Gore Vidal compared Norman Mailer to Charles Manson in Vidals review of The Prisoner of Sex When the two writers were guests on the same episode of The Dick Cavett Show Mailer punched Vidal in the hospitality room then brought up the review again on the live show Six years later at a party Mailer threw a drink in Vidals face and followed it with a punch Vidal is said to have responded "Norman once again words have failed you"

Gore Vidal and Truman Capote were competitive acquaintances who were initially cordial Their first open argument began at a party hosted by Tennessee Williams Williams said "They began to criticize each others work Gore told Truman he got all of his plots out of Carson McCullers and Eudora Welty Truman said Well maybe you get all of yours from the Daily News And so the fight was on"

In 1975 Vidal sued Capote for slander over the accusation that he had been thrown out of the White House for being drunk putting his arm around the first lady and then insulting Mrs Kennedys mother Capotes defense was damaged when Lee Radziwill refused to testify on Capotes behalf Despite her prior deposition Radziwill said "I do not recall ever discussing with Truman Capote the incident or the evening which I understand is the subject of this lawsuit" Ultimately Capote offered a pro forma apology and the suit was settled out of court

Vidal responded to news of Capotes death by calling it "a wise career move"

In June 1930 Lewis and Dreiser were in contention for the Nobel Prize in Literature Lewis won the first American to be awarded the prize Several months after the ceremony the writers encountered each other at the Metropolitan Club at a dinner honoring Boris Pilnyak After much drinking Lewis rose to give the welcome speech but instead declared he "did not care to speak in the presence of a man who has stolen three thousand words from my wifes book"

After dinner Dreiser approached Lewis and asked him to take back his statement When Lewis repeated it Dreiser recalls "I smacked him And I asked him if he wanted to say it again He said it again So I smacked him again" When another guest intervened Dreiser left saying "Ill meet you any time anywhere This thing isnt settled" The fight made headlines around the world even being referred to as "the slap heard round the world"

C P Snow and F R Leavis
British scientist and novelist C P Snow delivered The Two Cultures the first part of an influential 1959 Rede Lecture on 7 May 1959  Snows lecture condemned the British educational system as having since the Victorian era overrewarded the humanities (especially Latin and Greek language
Leavis called Snow a "public relations man" for the scientific establishment in his essay Two Cultures?: The Significance of C P Snow published in The Spectator in 1962 and wrote "as a novelist he doesnt existutterly without a glimmer of what creative literature is or why it matters" The article attracted a great deal of negative correspondence in the magazines letters pages and some of Snows friends suggested that he sue Leavis for defamation

Although Snow chose not to engage with Leavis others defended Snow In the United States a reviewer for The New Republic declared Leavis was acting out of "pure hysteria" and was displaying "persecution mania"
