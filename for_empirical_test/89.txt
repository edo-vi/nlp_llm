In plant biology the perforations in a perforate leaf are also described as fenestrae and the leaf is called a fenestrate leaf.  The leaf window is also known as a fenestra and is a translucent structure that transmits light as in Fenestraria.

Examples of fenestrate structures in the fungal kingdom include the symmetrically arranged gaps in the indusium ("skirt") of the mushroom Phallus duplicatus and the thallus of the coral lichen Pulchrocladia retipora.

Fenestrae are also used to distinguish the three types of amniote:
