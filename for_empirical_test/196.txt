SABRE Research UK was a British Charitable organizationIt addressed issues in systematic reviews of animal studies (published results of laboratory animal experiments) The charity was previously known as the Society for Accountability of Animal Studies in Biomedical Research and Education and was constituted in 2005 in response to disquiet about uninformed opinions about the scientific value of animal studies and dissatisfaction with attitude polarization
The charity was independent from political parties understanding animal research
 History 

The formation of the charity followed the publication of an Education and Debate paper in the BMJ in 2004 which expressed concerns about the lack of scientific evidence to support the claims made by animal research advocates The paper itself a systematic review was the first to call for systematic reviews of animal studies It also called for the prospective registration of all animal research projects licensed by the Home Office The authors were concerned that animal research is not conducted analysed and reported (published) as rigorously as clinical research which has reporting standards such as the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
In 2005 a report was published by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics which called for systematic reviews and metaanalyses to be carried out in order to ‘evaluate more fully the predictability and transferability of animal models The report concluded that At present there is a relatively limited number of useful systematic reviews and metareviews that address the question of the scientific validity of animal experiments and tests’ The report recommended that the programme be funded by the Home Office in collaboration with major funders of research such as the Wellcome Trust the Medical Research Council (UK)
A larger study was published in the BMJ in 2007 which drew attention to a lack of communication between animal researchers and clinical researchers and identified a gap in knowledge about the usefulness of the volume of animal studies that look at biological mechanisms of disease and that more systematic reviews are needed for a quantitative appraisal of the concordance between animal and clinical trials The review reiterated earlier calls for the Home Office to undertake prospective registration of animal studies The authors had found that the Home Office showed a lack of interest in the quality of recordkeeping needed for preparing systematic reviews

 SABREs priorities for research involving animals 

 Implementation of the 10Rs+ Strategy to include a full programme of Systematic reviews of existing animal studies before funding any new animal research http://bmcmedethicsbiomedcentralcom/articles/101186/s1291001500437
 Prospective registration of animal studies (to be maintained by the Home Office) with adequate details recorded to inform subsequent systematic reviews
 Adoption and implementation of the new guidelines (http://wwwplosbiologyorg/article/info%3Adoi%2F101371%2Fjournalpbio1000412 The ARRIVE Guidelines) on reporting animal research by authors journal editors peer reviewers and funding bodies
 A largescale programme of systematic reviews of existing animal studies (the published results of laboratory animal experiments) to be conducted to assess and monitor the value of animal research to the promotion of human health
