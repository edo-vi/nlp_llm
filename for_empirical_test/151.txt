 Background 
EvidenceNetworkca was established to address the complex debates leading up to the 2014 renegotiation of the Canada Health Accord and after to highlight evidence on health policy issues across the country The Director Dr Roos says "Health policy issues are increasingly complex and are too often taken over by politics and ideology We thought the best way to serve the Canadian public would be to create an accessible and reliable resource where journalists can quickly find independent experts and evidence on issues as they arise"

The site provides evidencebased medicine
The British Medical Journals EvidenceBased Medicine highlighted the work of the network as an example for how to facilitate "the science and art of combining opinion and evidence"  University Affairs says of the initiative "The project aims to break the traditional pattern of academics writing for other academics in journals that aren’t read by the mainstream press or of professors avoiding the media leaving a select few to appear again and again" JSource a professional publication for the Canadian media says of the network "its an ambitious initiative to get the latest and best findings in health sciences and policy research into the broader public conversation by engaging the media"  In an article for Healthcare Policy Dr Roos et al state that the project "seeks to improve the Canadian healthcare system and ultimately the health of Canadians by ensuring that our best health policy evidence is understood by journalists and accurately communicated to Canadians and policy makers"

EvidenceNetworkca was established in consultation with experienced media advisors health and health policy researchers and third party evidence brokers including the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Health Council of Canada
