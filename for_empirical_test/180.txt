Terminology and periodisation
File:Avignon Palais des Papes by JM RosierjpgThe Middle Ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analysing History of Europe
Medieval writers divided history into periods such as the Six Ages of the World
The most commonly given starting point for the Middle Ages is around 500 with 476—the year the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed—first used by Bruni but there is no universally agreedupon end date Depending on the context events such as the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 Christopher Columbuss first voyage to the Americas in 1492 or the Reformation

The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories Runaway inflation external pressure on the frontiers and Plague of Cyprian
The Emperor Diocletian (r 284–305) split the empire into separately administered Byzantine Empire
For much of the 4th century Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier Culture of ancient Rome
Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century diverting soldiers from the empires frontier forces and allowing BarbarianModern academia
When dealing with the migrations the Eastern Roman elites combined the deployment of armed forces with gifts and grants of offices to the tribal leaders whereas the Western aristocrats failed to support the army but also refused to pay tribute to prevent invasions by the tribes The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d 408) Flavius Aetius
Early Middle Ages


PostRoman kingdoms


File:Europe and the Near East at 476 ADpng
In the postRoman world the fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes is well documented Popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than had been common in the Roman state developed into legislative and judicial bodies Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes instead relying on granting them land or rents This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the Roman EmpireTaxation
The Germanic groups now collectively known as AngloSaxons settled in Britain before the middle of the 5th century The local culture had little impact on their way of life but the linguistic assimilation of masses of the local Celtic Britons to the newcomers is evident By around 600 new political centres emerged some local leaders accumulated considerable wealth and Heptarchy
File:Theoderic Quarter Siliqua 80000847jpg
The Ostrogoths moved to Italy from the Balkans in the late 5th century under Theoderic the Great (r 493–526) He set up Ostrogothic Kingdom
Other monarchies were established by the Visigoths in the Iberian Peninsula the Suebi in northwestern Iberia and the Vandals in North Africa Coming from the Asian steppes the nomadic Pannonian Avars
The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages Latin the literary language of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by vernacular languages which evolved from Latin but were distinct from it collectively known as Romance languages Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire but the migrations of the Slavs expanded the area of Slavic languages in Central Europe
Byzantine survival


File:Sanvitale03jpg
During this period the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century Here political life was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort – the Codex Theodosianus – was completed in 438 Under Emperor Justinian I
Justinian almost lost his throne during the Nika riots a popular revolt of elementary force that destroyed half of Constantinople in 532 After crushing the revolt he reinforced the autocratic elements of the imperial government and mobilized his troops against the Arian western kingdoms The general Belisarius (d 565) conquered Vandalic War
Justinians reconquests and excessive building program have been criticised by historians for bringing his realm to the brink of bankruptcy but many of the difficulties faced by Justinians successors were due to other factors including the epidemic and the massive expansion of the Avars and their Slav allies In the east border defences collapsed during a Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628
Western society


In Western Europe some of the older Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with ecclesiastical than secular affairs Values attached to Latin literature
Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian dynasty

Most of the early medieval descriptions of the lower classes come from either Code (law)
Roman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages Although Italian cities remained inhabited they contracted significantly in size Rome for instance shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30000 by the end of the 6th century In Northern Europe cities also shrank while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials The Jewish communities survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire in Spain southern Gaul and Italy The Visigothic kings made concentrated efforts to convert the Sephardic Jews
Rise of Islam

The Muslim conquerors bypassed the mountainous northwestern region of the Iberian Peninsula Here a small kingdom Kingdom of Asturias
Trade and economy

Migrations and conquests disrupted trade networks around the Mediterranean The replacement of goods from longrange trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands Nonlocal goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods or metalworks In the 7th and 8th centuries new commercial networks were developing in northern Europe Goods like furs walrus ivory and amber were delivered from the Baltic region to western Europe contributing to the development of new trade centers in East Anglia northern Francia and Scandinavia Conflicts over the control of trade routes and toll stations were common The various Germanic states in the west all had coinages that imitated existing Roman and Byzantine forms

The flourishing Islamic economies constant demand for fresh labour force and raw materials opened up a new market for Europe around 750 Europe emerged as a major supplier of house slaves and Mamluk
Church life


File:Gregory I  Antiphonary of Hartker of Sankt GallenjpgThe idea of Christian unity endured although differences in ideology and practice between the Eastern and Western Churches became apparent by the 6th century The formation of new realms reinforced the traditional Christian concept of the separation of church and state in the west whereas this notion was alien to eastern clergymen who regarded the Roman state as an instrument of divine providence Although the Byzantine Church condemned Byzantine Iconoclasm
Few of the Western bishops looked to the papacy for religious or political leadership The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain where Gregory had sent the Gregorian mission in 597 to convert the AngloSaxons to Christianity HibernoScottish mission
Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on religious and political life in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families and important centres of political authority They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin ClassicsClassical Rome

Charlemagne continued the Frankish tradition of dividing his empire between all his sons but only one son Louis the Pious (r 814–840) was still alive by 813 Just before Charlemagne died in 814 he made Louis coemperor Louiss reign was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire

By the Treaty of Verdun (843) a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair I to go with his lands in Italy and his imperial title was recognised Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modernday Germany Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands comprising most of modernday France Charlemagnes grandsons and greatgrandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost There was a brief reuniting of the empire by Charles the Fat in 884 although the actual units of the empire retained their separate administrations By the time he died early in 888 the Carolingians were close to extinction and nondynastic claimants assumed power in most of the successor states In the eastern lands the dynasty died out with the death of Louis the Child (r 899–911) and the selection of the Duchy of FranconiaFrankish culture and the Carolingian methods of state administration had a significant impact on the neighboring peoples Frankish threat triggered the formation of new states along the empires eastern frontier—Duchy of Bohemia
New kingdoms and Byzantine revival

Architecture and art



File:KellsFol032vChristEnthronedjpg
Under Constantine the Great and his successors basilicas large halls that had been used for administrative and commercial purposes were adapted for Christian worship and new basilicas were built in the major Roman cities and the postRoman kingdoms In the late 6th century Byzantine church architecture adopted an alternative model imitating the rectangular plan and the dome of Justinians Hagia Sophia the largest single roofed structure of the Roman world As the spacious basilicas became of little use with the decline of urban centres in the west they gave way to smaller churches By the beginning of the 8th century the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture One new standard feature of Carolingian basilicas is the use of a transept or the "arms" of a Tshaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave

Magnificent halls built of timber or stone were the centres of political and social life all over the early Middle Ages Their design often adopted elements of Late Roman architecture like pilasters columns and sculptured discs One or more towers now known as keeps were the most characteristic features of a medieval fortress Castles often developed into multifunctional compounds with their drawbridges fortified courtyards cisterns or wells halls chapels stables and workshops

Carolingian art was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles Insular art integrated the energy of Celtic art
Military and technology
During the later Roman Empire the principal military developments were attempts to create an effective cavalry force as well as the continued development of highly specialised types of troops The creation of heavily armoured cataphracttype soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the Late Roman military The various invading tribes had differing emphases on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry AngloSaxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier and weaker Scythian composite bow The Avar heavy cavalry introduced the use of stirrups in Europe and it was adopted by Byzantine cavalrymen before the end of the 6th century Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by Mail (armour)
The importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry Although much of the Carolingian armies were mounted a large proportion during the early period appear to have been mounted infantry rather than true cavalry The use of Conscription
High Middle Ages


Society

File:ClericKnightWorkmanjpgThe High Middle Ages was a period of tremendous Medieval demography
As much as 90&nbsp;per cent of the European population remained rural peasants Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into more defensible small communities usually known as Manorialism
With the development of heavy cavalry the previously more or less uniform class of free warriors split into two groups Those who could equip themselves as mounted knights were integrated into the traditional aristocracy but others were assimilated into the peasantry The position of the new aristocracy was stabilized through the adoption of strict inheritance customs such as primogeniture—the eldest sons right to inherit the family domains undivided Nobles were stratified in terms of the land and people over whom they held authority; the lowestranking nobles did not hold land and had to serve wealthier aristocrats who were in effect unfree knights They descended from serfs who had served as warriors or government officials which increased status allowed their descendants to hold fiefs as well as become knights while still being technically serfs Although constituting only about one per cent of the population the nobility was never a closed group: kings could raise commoners to the aristocracy wealthy commoners could marry into noble families and impoverished aristocrats sometimes gave up their privileged status The constant movement of Western aristocrats towards the peripheries of Latin Christendom was a featuring element of high medieval society The Frenchspeaking noblemen mainly settled in the British Isles southern Italy or Iberia whereas the German aristocrats preferred Central and Eastern Europe Their migration was often supported by the local rulers who highly appreciated their military skills but in many cases the newcomers were conquerors who established new lordships by force

The clergy was divided into two types: the secular clergy who cared for believers spiritual needs mainly serving in the parish churches; and the regular clergy who lived under a religious rule as monks Canon (clergy)
Women were officially required to be subordinate to some male whether their father husband or other kinsman Womens work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks such as childcare Peasant women could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home and they were also expected to help with fieldwork at harvesttime Townswomen could engage in trade but often only by right of their husband and unlike their male competitors they were not always allowed to train apprentices Noblewomen could inherit land in the absence of a male heir but their potential to give birth to children was regarded as their principal virtue The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns as they were unable to become priests

Trade and economy

File:Petrus alphonsi dialoguesjpgFile:Psalter World Map c1265jpgThe expansion of population greater agricultural productivity and relative political stability laid the foundations for the medieval "Commercial Revolution" in the 11th century People with surplus cash began investing in commodities like salt pepper and silk at faraway markets Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money and gold coinage was again minted in Europe first in Italy and later in France New forms of commercial contracts emerged allowing risk to be shared within the framework of partnerships known as  or  Bill of exchange
The Italian maritime republics such as Duchy of Amalfi
Economic growth provided opportunities to Jewish merchants to spread all over Europe Although most kings bishops and aristocrats appreciated the Jews contribution to the local economy many commoners regarded the nonChristian newcomers as an imminent threat to social cohesion As the Jews could not engage in prestigious trades outside their communities they often took despised jobs such as ragmen or tax collectors They were especially active in moneylending for they could ignore the Christian clerics condemnation on loan interest The Jewish moneylenders and pawn brokers reinforced antisemitism which led to accusations of blasphemy blood libels and pogroms Church authorities growing concerns about Jewish influence on Christian life inspired segregationist laws and even their permanent expulsion Edict of Expulsion
Technology and military

Technology developed mainly through minor innovations and by the adoption of advanced technologies from Asia through Muslim mediation Major technological advances included the first mechanical clocks the manufacture of distilled spirits and the use of the astrolabe Convex spectacles were probably invented around 1286 Windmills were first built in Europe in the 12th century spinning wheels appeared around 1200

The development of a threefield Crop rotation
The construction of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology leading to the development of large stone buildings Ancillary structures included new town halls hospitals bridges and tithe barns Shipbuilding improved with the use of the Boat building
In military affairs the use of infantry with specialised roles increased Along with the stilldominant heavy cavalry armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen as well as sappers and engineers Crossbows increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare This led to the use of closedface Combat helmet

In the 10th century the establishment of churches and monasteries led to the development of stone architecture that elaborated vernacular Roman forms from which the term "Romanesque" is derived Where available Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials From the tentative beginnings known as the First Romanesque the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form Just before 1000 there was a great wave of building stone churches all over Europe Romanesque architecture
Romanesque art especially metalwork was at its most sophisticated in Mosan art in which distinct artistic personalities including Nicholas of Verdun (d 1205) become apparent and an almost Ancient Greek art
File:Nef_cathédrale_Laonjpg
From the early 12th century French builders developed the Gothic architecture
During this period the practice of manuscript illumination gradually passed from monasteries to lay workshops so that according to Janetta Benton "by 1300 most monks bought their books in shops" and the book of hours developed as a form of devotional book for laypeople Metalwork continued to be the most prestigious form of art with Limoges enamel a popular and relatively affordable option In Italy the innovations of Cimabue and Duccio followed by the Trecento master Giotto (d 1337) greatly increased the sophistication and status of panel painting and fresco Increasing prosperity during the 12th century resulted in greater production of secular art; many ivory carving

Late Middle Ages


Famine and plague


Average annual temperature was declining from around 1200 introducing the gradual transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age Climate anomalies caused agricultural crises and famine culminating in the Great Famine of 1315–1317
File:Jacquerie Navarrejpg
These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death a pandemic that spread throughout Europe during the following three years killing about onethird of the population Towns were especially hardhit because of their crowded conditions The rapid and extremely high mortality destroyed economy and trade and the recovery was slow The peasants who survived the pandemic paid lower rents to the landlords but demand for agricultural products declined and the lower prices barely covered their costs Urban workers received higher salaries but they were heavily taxed Occasionally the governments tried to fix rural rents at a high level or to keep urban salaries low which provoked Popular revolt in latemedieval Europe
Society and economy
Society throughout Europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the Black Death Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe as landlords imposed it on tenants who had previously been free Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders and they joined to extort privileges from their governments Partly at the urging of landlords governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death Nonclergy became increasingly literate and urban populations began to imitate the nobilitys interest in chivalry

Jewish communities were Edict of Expulsion
State resurgence

Strong royaltybased nation states rose throughout Europe in the Late Middle Ages particularly in Kingdom of England
File:Joan of Arc miniature gradedjpgThroughout the 14th century French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France leading to the Hundred Years War waged from 1337 to 1453 Early in the war the English won the battles of Battle of Crécy
In modernday Germany the Holy Roman Empire continued to rule but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form Further east the kingdoms of Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)
Collapse of Byzantium and rise of the Ottomans


File:1396Battle of Nicopolisjpg
Although the Palaiologos emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261 they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)
Controversy within the Church

During the tumultuous 14th century disputes within the leadership of the Church led to the Avignon Papacy of 1309–76 also called the "Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy" (a reference to the Babylonian captivity of the Jews) and then to the Western Schism
Besides the schism the Western Church was riven by theological controversies some of which turned into heresies John Wycliffe (d 1384) an English theologian was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to Church doctrine Wycliffes teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussites
The papacy further refined the practice in the Mass (liturgy)
Scholars intellectuals and exploration

During the Later Middle Ages theologians such as Duns Scotus
File:Studying astronomy and geometryjpg
Education remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest but the secondary subjects of the trivium—grammar rhetoric logic—were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities Universities spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries Lay literacy rates rose but were still low; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten per cent of males and one per cent of females in 1500

The publication of vernacular literature increased with Dante Alighieri
In the early 15th century the countries of the Iberian Peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (d 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands the Azores and Cape Verde during his lifetime After his death exploration continued; Bartolomeu Dias (d 1500) went around the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 and Vasco da Gama (d 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498 The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus (d 1506) in 1492 that led to his discovery of the Americas The English crown under Henry VII of England


Technological and military developments
File:Crescenzi calendarjpg
One of the major developments in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was the increased use of infantry and light cavalry The English also employed longbowmen but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success Armour continued to advance spurred by the increasing power of crossbows and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the handheld guns that were developed Pole weapon
In agriculture the increased usage of sheep with longfibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun In addition the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff tripling production A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily life was the use of buttons as closures for garments Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill allowing the upper part of the windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality The first Patent
Late medieval art and architecture
File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry févrierjpg
The Late Middle Ages in Europe as a whole correspond to the Trecento and Early Renaissance cultural periods in Italy Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century until almost the end of the period International Gothic was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around 1400 producing masterpieces such as the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry All over Europe secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality and in the 15th century the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons commissioning small portraits as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)
The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved as in the Pulpit of Sant Andrea Pistoia (Giovanni Pisano)
Modern perceptions


File:Gossuin de Metz  Limage du monde  BNF Fr 574 fo42jpg
The medieval period is frequently caricatured as a "time of ignorance and superstition" that placed "the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity" This is a legacy from both the Renaissance and Age of Enlightenment
Others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages Science historian Edward Grant writes "If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed in the 18th century<!original quotation says: "expressed in the Age of Reason"> they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities" Also contrary to common belief David C Lindberg
The caricature of the period is also reflected in some more specific notions One misconception first propagated in the 19th century is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Myth of the flat Earth
