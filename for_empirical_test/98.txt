The Kivu Ebola epidemicrefn
A military conflict in the region that had begun in January 2015 hindered treatment and prevention efforts The World Health Organization (WHO) described the combination of military conflict and civilian distress as a potential "perfect storm" that could lead to a rapid worsening of the outbreak In May 2019 the WHO reported that since January 85 health workers had been wounded or killed in 42 attacks on health facilities In some areas aid organizations had to stop their work due to violence Health workers also had to deal with misinformation spread by opposing politicians

Due to the deteriorating security situation in North Kivu and surrounding areas the WHO raised the risk assessment at the national and regional level from "high" to "very high" in September 2018 In October the United Nations Security Council stressed that all armed hostility in the DRC should come to a stop to better fight the ongoing EVD outbreak and on 17 July 2019 the WHO announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound

On 15 September 2019 some slowdown of EVD cases was noted by the WHO in DRC  New cases dwindled to zero by 17 February 2020 but after 52 days without a case surveillance and response teams on the ground confirmed three new cases of Ebola in Beni health zone in midApril  On 25 June 2020 the outbreak was declared ended

As a new and separate outbreak the Congolese health ministry reported on 1 June 2020 that there were cases of Ebola in Équateur Province in northwestern DRC described as the eleventh Ebola outbreak since records began This separate outbreak was declared over as of 18 November following no reported cases for 42 days and caused 130 cases and 55 deaths

Epidemiology
As indicated below and per numbers offered by the United Nations the final death toll was 2280 with a total of 3470 cases in DRC in almost a twoyear period This was made very difficult due to the ongoing military attacks in the region which created a perfect storm for the virus despite there being a vaccine rVSVZEBOV  or Ebola Zaire vaccine live is a vaccine that prevents Ebola caused by the Zaire ebolavirus The graph of reported cases reflects cases that were not able to have a laboratory test sample before burial as probable cases

Democratic Republic of the Congo
File:DRC cases south and north kivu  iturijpgOn 1 August 2018 the North Kivu health division notified Congos health ministry of 26 cases of hemorrhagic fever including 20 deaths Four of the six samples that were sent for analysis to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa came back positive for Ebola and an outbreak was declared on that date
The index case is believed to have been the death and unsafe burial of a 65yearold woman on 25 July in Mangina quickly followed by the deaths of seven close family members This outbreak started just days after the end of the 2018 Équateur province Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola virus outbreakOn 4 August the WHO indicated that the current situation in the DRC due to several factors warranted a "high risk assessment" at the national and regional level for public health

By 3 August the virus had developed in multiple locations; cases were reported in five health zones&nbsp;– Beni Democratic Republic of the Congo
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu indicated on 15 August that the outbreak then in the DRC might be worse than the West African Ebola virus epidemic
In November it was reported that the EVD outbreak ran across two provinces and 14 health zones By 23 December the EVD outbreak had spread to more health zones and at that time 18 such areas had been affected

Becoming the 2nd biggest EVD outbreak
On 7 August 2018 the DRC Ministry of Public Health indicated that the total count had climbed to almost 90 cases and the Ministry of Health (Uganda)On 17 August 2018 the WHO reported that there were around 1500 "contact tracing
On 24 September it was reported that all contact tracing and vaccinations would stop for the foreseeable future in Beni due to a deadly attack by rebel groups the day before On 25 September Peter Salama of the WHO indicated that insecurity was obstructing efforts to stop the virus and believed a combination of factors could establish conditions for an epidemic On 18 October the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) raised its travelers alert to the DRC from a level 1 to level 2 for all US travelers On 26 October the WHO indicated that half of confirmed cases were not showing any fever symptoms thus making diagnosis more difficult

According to a September 2018 The Lancet
On 6 November 2018 the CDC indicated that the current outbreak in the east region of the DRC was potentially noncontainable This would be the first time since 1976 that an outbreak was not able to be curbed On 13 November the WHO indicated that the viral outbreak would last at least six months

On 29 December 2018 the DRC Ministry of Public Health announced that there had been "0 new confirmed cases detected because of the paralysis of the activities of the response in Beni Butembo Komanda and Mabalako" and no vaccination had occurred for three consecutive days On 22 January the total case count approached 1000 cases (951 suspected) in the DRC Ministry of Public Health situation report The graphs below demonstrate the EVD intensity in different locations in the DRC as well as in the West African epidemic of 2014–15 as a comparison:

On 16 March 2019 the director of the CDC indicated that the outbreak in the DRC could last another year additionally suggesting that vaccine supplies could run out According to the WHO resistance to vaccination in the Kaniyi Health Zone was ongoing as of March 2019
File:Bar graph of Democratic Republic of the Congo outbreaks 1976presentjpgUntil the outbreak in North Kivu in 2018 no outbreak had surpassed 320 total cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo By 24 February 2019 the epidemic had surpassed 1000 total cases (1048)

On 10 May 2019 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the outbreak could eventually surpass the West African epidemic

The 12 May 2019 issue of WHO Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other Emergencies indicates that "continued increase in the number of new EVD cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is worryingno end in sight to the difficult security situation"
On 25 November 2019 it was reported that violence had broken out in Beni again to such a degree that some aid agencies had evacuated According to the same report around 300 individuals might have been exposed to EVD via an infected individual

Spread to Goma
On 14 July 2019 the first case of EVD was confirmed in the capital of North Kivu Goma a city with an international airport and a highly mobile population of 2million people located near the DRCs eastern border with Rwanda This case was a man who had passed through three health checkpoints with different names on traveller lists whereas according to Reuters he died en route to a treatment centre This case triggered the decision by the WHO to again reconvene an emergency committee where the situation was officially declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern

On 30 July a second case of EVD was confirmed in the city of Goma apparently not linked to the first case Across the border from Goma in the country of Rwanda Ebola simulation drills were being conducted at health facilities A third case of EVD was confirmed in Goma on 1 August On 22 August 2019 Nyiragongo Territory
Spread to South Kivu Province
On 16 August 2019 it was reported that the Ebola virus disease had spread to a third province – South Kivu – via two new cases who had travelled from Beni North Kivu By 22 August the number of cases in Mwenga had risen to four including one person at a health facility visited by the first case

Uganda

File:Uganda Distrikt Kasesesvg
In August 2018 a United Nations
According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
On 21 September officials of the DRC indicated a confirmed case of EVD at Lake Albert (Africa)
On 2 November it was reported that the Ugandan government would start vaccinating health workers along the border with the DRC as a proactive measure against the virus Vaccinations started on 7 November and by 13 June 2019 4699 health workers at 165 sites had been vaccinated Proactive vaccination was also carried out in South Sudan with 1471 health workers vaccinated by 7 May 2019

On 2 January 2019 it was reported that refugee movement from the DRC to Uganda had increased after the presidential elections On 12 February it was reported that 13 individuals had been isolated due to their contact with a suspected Ebola case in Uganda; lab results came back negative several hours later

On 11 June 2019 the WHO reported that the virus had spread to Uganda A 5yearold Congolese boy entered Uganda on the previous Sunday with his family to seek medical care On 12 June the WHO reported that the 5yearold patient had died while 2 more cases of Ebola infection within the same family were also confirmed On 14 June it was reported that there were 112 contacts since EVD was first detected in Uganda Ring vaccination of Ugandan contacts was scheduled to start on 15 June

On 14 July an individual entered the country of Uganda from DRC while symptomatic for EVD; a search for contacts in Mpondwe followed On 24 July Uganda marked the needed 42 day period without any EVD cases to be declared Ebolafree On 29 August a 9yearold Congolese girl became the fourth individual in Uganda to test positive for EVD when she crossed from the DRC into the district of Kasese

Tanzania
File:Tanzania relief location mapsvgIn regards to possible EVD cases in Tanzania the WHO stated on 21 September 2019 that "to date the clinical details and the results of the investigation including laboratory tests performed for differential diagnosis of these patients have not been shared with WHO The insufficient information received by WHO does not allow for a formulation of a hypotheses regarding the possible cause of the illness" On 27 September the CDC and US State Department alerted potential travellers to the possibility of unreported EVD cases within Tanzania

The Tanzanian Health Minister Ummy Mwalimu stated on 3 October 2019 that there was no Ebola outbreak in Tanzania The WHO were provided with a preparedness update on 18 October which outlined a range of actions and included commentary that since the outbreak commenced there had been "29 alerts of Ebola suspect cases reported 17 samples tested and were negative for Ebola (including 2 in September 2019)"

Countries with medically evacuated individuals
On 29 December an American physician who was exposed to the Ebola virus (and who was nonsymptomatic) was evacuated and taken to the University of Nebraska Medical Center On 12 January the individual was released after 21 days without symptoms

Outbreak and military conflict


File:Goma  North Kivu (21070159821)jpgAt the time of the epidemic there were about 70 armed military groups among them the Alliance of Patriots for a Free and Sovereign Congo and the MaiMayi Nduma défense du CongoRénové in North Kivu The fighting displaced thousands of individuals and seriously affected the response to the outbreak According to the WHO health care workers were to be accompanied by military personnel for protection and ring vaccination may not be possible On 11 August 2018 it was reported that seven individuals were killed in MayiMoya due to a militant group about 24 miles from the city of Beni Democratic Republic of the Congo
On 24 August 2018 it was reported that an Ebolastricken physician had been in contact with 97 individuals in an inaccessible military area who hence could not be diagnosed In September it was reported that 2 United Nations peacekeeping
On 20 October 2018 an armed rebel group in the DRC killed 13 civilians and took 12 children as hostages in Beni which was then experiencing one of the worst outbreaks On 11 November six people were killed in an attack by an armed rebel group in Beni; as a consequence vaccinations were suspended there Yet another attack reported on 17 November in Beni by an armed rebel group forced the cessation of EVD containment efforts and WHO staff to evacuate to another DRC city for the time being Beni continued to be the site of attacks by militant groups as 18 civilians were killed on 6 December On 22 December it was reported that 2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election
On 29 December 2018 Oxfam said it would suspend its work due to the ongoing violence in the DRC; on the same day the International Rescue Committee suspended their Ebola support efforts as well On 18 January the African Union indicated that presidential election results announcements should be suspended in the DRC

Pathogen
File:Rousettus aegyptiacus 1jpg


The Ministry of Public Health (Democratic Republic of the Congo)
The natural reservoir of the virus is thought to be the Megabat
Viral mechanism

A significant part of the actual EVD infection is based on immune suppression along with systemic inflammation leading to multiple organ failure and Shock (circulatory)
Genetic epidemiology
Genetic epidemiology is a medical field that studies how genetic factors and the environment interact in this case the outbreak affecting the populations of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the neighboring country of Uganda  Genetic sequencing had already identified another unrelated strain of Zaire ebolavirus that was implicated in 2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreakFile:Genomic epidemiology of the 201819 Ebola epidemicjpg
 Transmission 
Ebola virus is found in a variety of bodily fluids such as breast milk saliva stool blood and semen rendering it highly contagious due to ease of contact Although a few transmission methods are known there is a possibility that many other methods are unknown and must be further researched Here are some potential routes of transmission:
 Droplets: Droplet transmission occurs when contact is made with viruscontaining droplets
 Fomites: Occurs when an individual comes in contact with a pathogencontaining surface
 Bodily fluids: The most common way of transmitting the Ebola virus in humans is through contact with infected bodily fluids

Those infected by EVD generally gain immunity although it is considered possible that such immunity is only temporary On 31 October 2019 it was reported that an EVD survivor who had been assisting at a treatment center in Beni had been reinfected with EVD and died; such an incident was unprecedented

Containment and control
Even with the advances made in vaccine technology and treatment options during previous Ebola outbreaks effective control of the North Kivu Epidemic continued to rely on traditional public health efforts including the timely identification and isolation of cases control measures in hospital settings identification and followup of contacts community engagement and safe burials Data from the West African Ebola Outbreak showed that response strategies that achieved 60% efficacy for sanitary burial case isolation and contacttracing combined could have greatly reduced the daily number of Ebola cases and ended the outbreak after only 6 months

Surveillance and contact tracing
Contact tracing is defined as the identification and followup of persons who may have been in contact with a person infected with Ebola Ideally close contacts are observed for 21 days after their last known exposure to a case and isolated if they become symptomatic The volume of contacts and the duration of monitoring presented challenges in Ebola surveillance as it required careful recordkeeping by properly trained and equipped staff To strengthen surveillance activities the DRC Ministry of Health began disseminating standardized Ebola case definitions developed reporting tools and communication strategies and began distribution of daily situation reports

In North Kivu and Ituri outbreaks of sporadic violence and suspicion of the response in parts of some affected communities impacted heavily on disease surveillance Poor record keeping by local health facilities also made it difficult or impossible to identify and trace contacts that might have been exposed to the disease while they were undergoing treatment for other illness at health centers Additionally the high degree of mobility of affected populations combined with occasional mistrust of the response has meant that contacts that had been identified have sometimes been lost to followup for extended periods Initially it was estimated that 3050% of contacts may not have originally been registered by contact tracing teams

 Community engagement and awareness 
Surveys among the affected population in North Kivu and Ituri showed both general mistrust with the Ebola response partly related to years of mistrust of any governmental or external action and specific opposition to the response because of conflicts with local cultural practices Some of the cultural practices which complicated the Ebola response included eating bush meat regular gatherings at family or village events and traditional funeral practices which were events that were particularly high risk for Ebola transmission

 Misinformation 

Combatting misinformation was a key element in overcoming Ebola in North Kivu One study using surveys found that low institutional trust coupled with a belief in misinformation about Ebola were inversely associated with preventive behaviors in individuals including Ebola vaccine acceptance Belief in misinformation regarding Ebola was widespread with 25% of respondents reporting that they did not believe the Ebola outbreak was real Some of the rumors that were being circulated included statements that the outbreak did not exist it was Ebola conspiracy theoriesOrigins theories
 Delay in seeking treatment 
Early in the epidemic there were delays in patients seeking care for Ebola because the initial cases were misdiagnosed Ebola symptoms were similar to symptoms of more common infectious diseases such as malaria flu and typhoid fever so patients would wait until their clinical situation deteriorated dangerously usually after failure to respond to antimalarial and/or antibiotic regimens before reporting to the hospitals

 Burials 
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
Travel restrictions and border closings
On 26 July 2019 it was reported that the country of Saudi Arabia would not allow visas from the DRC after the WHO declared it an international emergency due to EVD On 1 August 2019 the country of Rwanda closed its border with the DRC after multiple cases in the city of Goma which borders the country in the upper Northwestern region

To minimize the risk of the spread to neighboring countries screening points which consisted of temperature and symptom monitoring were established at many border crossings Over 2 million screenings were undertaken during the outbreak which no doubt contributed to the containment of the epidemic within DRC

Treatment


In August 2018 the WHO evaluated several drugs used to treat EVD including Remdesivir ZMapp atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab ansuvimab and favipiravir The drug ansuvimab (which is a monoclonal antibody) was deployed for the first time to treat infected individuals during this EVD outbreak

In November 2018 the DRC gave approval to start randomized clinical trials for EVD treatment On 12 August 2019 it was announced that two clinical trial medications were found to improve the rate of survival in those infected by EVD: atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab a cocktail of three monoclonal Ebola antibodies and ansuvimab These two will be further used in therapy; when used shortly after infection they were found to have a 90% survival rate ZMapp and Remdesivir were subsequently discontinued

In October 2020 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab with an Indication (medicine)
Vaccination
File:Ebola Geimpfte 311218 englischpng
On 8 August 2018 the process of vaccination began with rVSVZEBOV Ebola vaccine While several studies have shown the vaccine to be safe and protective against the virus additional research is needed before it can be licensed Consequently the WHO reported that it was being used under a ring vaccination strategy with what is known as "compassionate use" to protect persons at highest risk of the Ebola outbreak ie contacts of those infected contacts of those contacts and frontline medical personnel As of 15 September according to the WHO almost a quarter of a million individuals had been vaccinated in the outbreak

On 20 September 2019 it was reported that a second vaccine by Johnson & Johnson would be introduced in the current EVD epidemic in the DRC

In November 2019 the World Health Organization prequalified an Ebola vaccine rVSVZEBOV for the first time As of 22 February 2020 a total of 297275 people had been vaccinated since the start of the outbreak By 21 June 2020 303905 people had been vaccinated with rVSVZEBOV and 20339 were given the initial dose of Ad26ZEBOV/MVABNFILO

Vaccination has helped to contain the epidemic though military attacks and community resistance have complicated distribution of the vaccines

Pregnant and lactating women
Based on a lack of evidence about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy the DRC ministry of health and the WHO decided to cease vaccinating women who were pregnant or lactating Some authorities criticized this decision as ethically "utterly indefensible" They noted that as caregivers of the sick pregnant and lactating women are more likely to contract Ebola They also noted that since it is known that almost 100% of pregnant women who contract Ebola will die a safety concern should not be a deciding factor As of June 2019 pregnant and lactating women were also being vaccinated

Vaccine stockpile
The Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Public Health
As of August 2019 Merck & Co the producers of the vaccine in use reported a stockpile sufficient for 500000 individuals with more in production

Effectiveness
In April 2019 the WHO published the preliminary results of its research in association with the DRCs Institut National pour la Recherche Biomedicale into the effectiveness of the ring vaccination program including data from 93965 atrisk people who had been vaccinated WHO stated that the rVSVZEBOVGP vaccine had been 975% effective at stopping Ebola transmission The vaccine had also reduced mortality among those who were infected after vaccination The ring vaccination strategy was effective at reducing EVD in contacts of contacts (tertiary cases) with only two such cases being reported

Treatment centres

In August 2018 the Mangina Ebola Treatment Center was reported to be operational A fourth Ebola Treatment Center (after those in Mangina Beni Democratic Republic of the Congo
In February 2019 it was reported that attacks at treatment centers had been carried out in Butembo and Katwa The motives behind the attacks were unclear Due to the violence international aid organizations had to stop their work in the two communities In April an epidemiologist from WHO was killed and two health workers injured in a militia attack on Butembo University Hospital in Katwa In May WHOs health emergencies chief said insecurity had become a "major impediment" to controlling the outbreak He reported that since January there had been 42 attacks on health facilities and 85 health workers had been wounded or killed "Every time we have managed to regain control over the virus and contain its spread we have suffered major major security events We are anticipating a scenario of continued intense transmission"

Healthcare workers
Health workers must wear personal protection equipment during treatment of those affected by the virus
On 3 September 2018 WHO stated that 16 health workers had contracted the virus
On 10 December the WHO reported that the current DRC outbreak had led to 49 healthcare workers contracting the Ebola virus and 15 had died
As of 30 April 2019 there have been 92 health care workers in the DRC infected with EVD of which 33 had died With false rumors being spread by wordofmouth and social media residents remain mistrustful and fearful of health care workers In January 2020 it was reported that there had been nearly 400 attacks on medical workers since the outbreak began in 2018

PostEbola virus syndrome

In terms of prognosis aside from the possible effects of postEbola syndrome there is also the reality of survivors returning to communities where they might be shunned due to the fear many have towards the Ebola virus hence psychosocial assistance is needed Many survivors of EVD face serious side effects including but not limited to the following:columnslist Joint pain
 Muscle pain
 Chest pain
 Hearing loss
 Hair loss
 Memory problems
 Anxiety attacks
 Vision loss


History
File:Ebola Virus  Electron Micrographtiff

The Ebola virus disease outbreak in Zaire (Yambuku) started in late 1976 and was the second outbreak ever after the earlier one in Sudan the same year On 1 August 2018 the tenth Ebola outbreak was declared in the DRC only a few days after 2018 Équateur province Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola virus outbreak

Learning from other responses such as in the List of Ebola outbreaks

Statistical measures
One way to measure the outbreak is via the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> a statistical measure of the average number of people expected to be infected by one person with a disease If the basic reproduction number is less than 1 the infection dies out; if it is greater than 1 the infection continues to spread—with exponential growth in the number of cases A March 2019 paper by Tariq et al suggested that R<sub>0</sub> was oscillating around 09

Response
During the Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo a number of organizations helped in different capacities:
Caritas Internationalis
WHO
File:World Health Organization LogosvgOn 12 April 2019 the WHO Emergency Committee was reconvened by the WHO DirectorGeneral after an increase in the rate of new cases and determined that the outbreak still failed to meet the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)

Following the confirmation of Ebola crossing into Uganda a third review by the WHO on 14 June 2019 Following a case in Goma the reconvening of a fourth review was announced on 15 July 2019

Sex abuse accusations
In September 2021 a commission found that between 2018 and 2020 WHO staff had engaged in sex abuse and rape The report prompted WHOs chief Tedros Adhanom to issue a formal apology to those women and girls affected

World Bank
The World Bank was criticised when its Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility intended to support countries affected by pandemic diseases had only paid out $31&nbsp;million of a potential total of $425&nbsp;million by August 2019 while generating substantial returns for investors  The conditions used to decide when the fund should pay out to diseaseaffected countries were criticised as too stringent

International governments
Financial support has been contributed by the governments of the US and the UK among others The UK Department for International Development
Subsequent outbreaks and other regional health issues
2020 Équateur province
On 1 June 2020 the Congolese health ministry announced a new DRC outbreak of Ebola in Mbandaka Équateur Province a region along the Congo River This area was the site of the 2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreak which infected 53 people and resulted in 29 deaths That outbreak was quickly brought under control with the use of the Ebola vaccine

Genome sequencing suggested that this 2020 outbreak the 11th outbreak since the virus was first discovered in the country in 1976 was unrelated to the one in North Kivu Province or the previous outbreak in the same area in 2018  It was reported that six cases had been identified with four fatalities It was expected that more people would be identified as surveillance activities increased

The WHO assisted with the response to this outbreak in part using the structures put in place for the 2018 outbreak Testing and contact tracing was used and additional medical staff had been sent in Médecins Sans Frontières was also on hand to give assistance if needed The outbreak added to an already difficult time for the Congo due to both Coronavirus disease 2019
By 8 June a total of 12 cases had been identified in and around Mbandaka and 6 deaths due to the virus The WHO said 300 people in Mbandaka and the surrounding Équateur province had been vaccinated By 15 June the case count had increased to 17 with 11 deaths with more than 2500 people having been vaccinated On 17 October it had increased to 128 cases and 53 deaths despite an effective vaccine being available As of 18 November the World Health Organization has had no reported cases of Ebola in Équateur province for 42 days; therefore the outbreak is over In the end there were 130 cases and 55 dead due to the virus
