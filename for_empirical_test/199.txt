Geoheritage (a blend of geological and heritage) is the geological aspect of Natural heritageIt is a heritage category comparable to other forms of natural heritage such as biodiversity

History of the concept
The first reference to geoheritage as such was at a 1993 conference held in the UK the Malvern International Conference on Geological and Landscape Conservation

The term geological heritage was first mentioned at the First International Symposium on the Conservation of our Geological Heritage at DignelesBains
Conceptually geoheritage derives from various writings of Busby et al 2001 and Hallam 1989)

In Sharples 1995 the original concept of geoheritage further developed to include the protection of dynamic geological processes and geodiversity

In Sadry 2021 the concept of geoheritage have more developed to include the vertical destinations: planetary(Space)geology

Definition

"Geoheritage encompasses global national statewide and local features of geology at all scales that are intrinsically important sites or culturally important sites offering information or insights into the evolution of the Earth; or into the history of science or that can be used for research teaching or reference"

The definition of geoheritage is based on the Regulation of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Republic of Indonesia No1 of 2020 concerning Guidelines for the Determination of Geological Heritage (Geoheritage) is Geological Diversity (Geodiversity) which has more value as a legacy because it is a record that has happened or is happening on earth due to its value scientifically high rare unique and beautiful so that it can be used for research and education in the earth

Geotourism


"Geotourism is a knowledge based tourism an interdisciplinary integration of the tourism industry with conservation and interpretation of abiotic nature attributes besides considering related cultural issues within the geosites for the general public" It is seen around the world through the growth of geoparks as well as independently in many natural and urban areas where tourism’s focus is on the geological environment

Examples of geoheritage sites

Australia
In Australia the term geoheritage appeared initially in Bradbury (1993) and Sharples (1993)

In Australia there are sites which have natural features (such as Fossil Hill at Cliefden Caves NSW); cultural features (such as the site of the discovery of the first limestone in inland Australia at Cliefden Caves); scenically important sites such as the Three Sisters (Australia)
Indonesia

The Geological Agency of the Indonesian Energy and Resources Ministry has declared nine geological sites in the province of Special Region of Yogyakarta
In Sleman Regency:

 Eocene limestone at Gamping (just to the west of Yogyakarta city)
 Pillow lava at Berbah (south of Prambanan temple area)
 Prehistoric volcanic sediment at Candi Ijo (south of Prambanan temple area)
 Prambanan temple area (east of Yogyakarta city)

In Bantul Regency:

 Sand dunes at Parangtritis beach (south of Yogyakarta city)

In Kulon Progo Regency:
 Kiskendo cave and a former site of manganese mining (over 8000 ha) in the Kliripan area

In Gunung Kidul Regency:

 Nglanggerang prehistoric volcano (near Patuk east of Yogyakarta city)
 WediomboSiung beach (on the south coast of Java)
 A bioturbation site on the Kali Ngalang (Ngalang river) near Ngalang village north of Wonosari

Spain

The Geological Society of Spain and the Geological and Mining Institute of Spain have produced a list of internationally important geosites (sites of geological interest known as LIGS in Spanish)
This work which began in 1999 is part of the Global Geosites project promoted by the International Union of Geological Sciences in the 1990s and subsequently supported by UNESCO Initially geological contexts were identified (21 such contexts were listed by 2014) and then representative sites within these themes  The list of sites is not a closed one and there is a mechanism for considering further nominations

Teide volcano Tenerife has been designated a World Heritage Site in part for its geological interest  Some other WHSs in Spain are of geological interest but were selected for other features  For example Spain has one of the two sites of the WHS Heritage of Mercury Almadén and Idrija However the criteria by which Almadén was assessed by UNESCO relate to its mining heritage rather than geological interest

Ethiopia
With its diversified lithology dissected landscapes and rock churches there is a large amount of geoheritage in Ethiopia Among the better documented geosites there is the Zeyi cave  in Degua Tembien
