Notable incidents

In 1896 Spyridon Belokas rode in a carriage for part of the athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Mens marathon
In 1904 Frederick Lorz dropped out of athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics – Mens marathon
In October 1979 Rosie Ruiz rode the New York City Subway during the New York City Marathon In doing so she qualified for the April 1980 Boston Marathon where she appeared to have won the womens race in a course record time: after it was discovered she had only run the last halfmile (800m) of the race her medal was revoked and her result deleted from the records; in any case the discovery that Ruiz had cut the course in New York would have been enough to automatically disqualify her from Boston

In 2007 Roberto Madrazo a Mexican presidential candidate in 2006 had his results in the Berlin Marathon deleted after his timing chip revealed Madrazo had skipped two checkpoints on the course and had covered one ninemile segment in 21 minutes (far faster than world record speed for such a distance)<ref>
