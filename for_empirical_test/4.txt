 Oral literature

Australian Aboriginal culture has thrived on oral traditions and oral histories passed down through tens of thousands of years

Oral literature is an Oral traditionBlockquoteThe JudeoChristian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homers oral style () Indeed if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be Rather if the whole truth is told oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and in many areas still a contemporary reality

The earliest poetry is believed to have been recited or sung employed as a way of remembering oral history
In Asia the transmission of folklore mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India in different Indian religions was by oral tradition preserved with precision with the help of elaborate Vedic chant
The early Buddhist texts are also generally believed to be of oral tradition with the first by comparing inconsistencies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as the Greek Serbia and other cultures then noting that the Vedic literature is too consistent and vast to have been composed and transmitted orally across generations without being written down<!

All ancient Greek literature was to some degree oral in nature and the earliest literature was completely so Homers epic poetry states Michael Gagarin was largely composed performed and transmitted orally As folklores and legends were performed in front of distant audiences the singers would substitute the names in the stories with local characters or rulers to give the stories a local flavor and thus connect with the audience but making the historicity embedded in the oral tradition as unreliable The lack of surviving texts about the Greek and Roman religious traditions have led scholars to presume that these were ritualistic and transmitted as oral traditions but some scholars disagree that the complex rituals in the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations were an exclusive product of an oral tradition

Writing systems are not known to have existed among Native North Americans (north of Mesoamerica) before contact with Europeans Oral storytelling traditions flourished in a context without the use of writing to record and preserve history scientific knowledge and social practices While some stories were told for amusement and leisure most functioned as practical lessons from tribal experience applied to immediate moral social psychological and environmental issues Stories fuse fictional supernatural or otherwise exaggerated characters and circumstances with real emotions and morals as a means of teaching Plots often reflect real life situations and may be aimed at particular people known by the storys audience In this way social pressure could be exerted without directly causing embarrassment or social exclusion For example rather than yelling Inuit culture

 Publishing

Aesthetics


 Literary theory 

A fundamental question of literary theory is "what is literature?" – although many contemporary theorists and literary scholars believe either that "literature" cannot be defined or that it can refer to any use of language

Literary fiction

File:Parnaso 09jpgLiterary fiction is a term used to describe fiction that explores any facet of the human condition and may involve social commentary It is often regarded as having more artistic merit than genre fiction especially the most commercially oriented types but this has been contested in recent years with the serious study of genre fiction within universities

The following by the awardwinning British author William Boyd (writer)
<blockquote>short stories seem to answer something very deep in our nature as if for the duration of its telling something special has been created some essence of our experience extrapolated some temporary sense has been made of our common turbulent journey towards the grave and oblivion</blockquote>

The very best in literature is annually recognized by the Nobel Prize in Literature which is awarded to an author from any country who has in the words of the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel produced "in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction" (original Swedish: den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning)

The value of imaginative literature

Some researchers suggest that literary fiction can play a role in an individuals psychological development Psychologists have also been using literature as a therapeutic tool Psychologist Hogan argues for the value of the time and emotion that a person devotes to understanding a characters situation in literature; that it can unite a large community by provoking universal emotions as well as allowing readers access to different cultures and new emotional experiences One study for example suggested that the presence of familiar cultural values in literary texts played an important impact on the performance of minority students

and the Quran

The King James Version of the Bible has been called "the most influential version of the most influential book in the world in what is now its most influential language" "the most important book in English religion and culture" and "the most celebrated book in the Englishspeaking world"  principally because of its literary style and widespread distribution Prominent Atheism

 Poetry 

File:Calligrammejpg
Poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its greater use of the Aesthetics
Prior to the 19th century poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines: "any kind of subject consisting of  or Verses" As a form it may predate literacy with the earliest works being composed within and sustained by an oral tradition; hence it constitutes the earliest example of literature

 Prose 
As noted above prose generally makes far less use of the aesthetic qualities of language than poetry However developments in modern literature including free verse and prose poetry have tended to blur the differences and American poet TS Eliot suggested that while: "the distinction between Verse (poetry)
On the historical development of prose Richard Graff notes that "In the case of ancient Greece recent scholarship has emphasized the fact that formal prose was a comparatively late development an "invention" properly associated with the Classical antiquity
Latin was a major influence on the development of prose in many European countries Especially important was the great Roman orator Cicero It was the lingua franca among literate Europeans until quite recent times and the great works of Descartes (1596 – 1650) Francis Bacon (1561 – 1626) and Baruch Spinoza (1632 – 1677) were published in Latin Among the last important books written primarily in Latin prose were the works of Emanuel Swedenborg
Novel
File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas BerlinJPG

A novel is a long fictional prose narrative In English the term emerged from the Romance languages in the late 15th century with the meaning of "news"; it came to indicate something new without a distinction between fact or fiction The romance is a closely related long prose narrative Walter Scott defined it as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents" whereas in the novel "the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society" Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is le roman der Roman il romanzo" indicates the proximity of the forms

Although there are many historical prototypes socalled "novels before the novel" the modern novel form emerges late in cultural history—roughly during the eighteenth century Initially subject to much criticism the novel has acquired a dominant position amongst literary forms both popularly and critically

Short story
