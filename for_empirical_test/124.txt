Those who oppose the strategy note that running up the score may be considered poor sportsmanship by fans players and coaches but there have been different opinions of how big an insult running up the score is Allegations of poor sportsmanship are also often brought up soon after a team scores multiple times near the end of a onesided match Running up the score can also cause injuries to a games starting players can lead to less game experience for junior varsity
Those who favor of running up the score argue that are potential benefits to running up the score such catering to polls (when they are used to determine team rankings) getting additional experience for players and to prevent potential Comeback (sports)
Justifications
Benefits in the BCS and other polls
Some sports (especially American College sports in the United States
From the 2014 season the BCS was replaced by the College Football Playoff (CFP) Polls do not play a role in determining CFP participants; instead these teams are chosen by a selection committee similar to that used in the NCAA basketball tournament selection process

Practice
Some fans of teams whose coaches frequently run up the score may also note that running up the score has its advantages Though many coaches who run up the score do it with only their firststring players a coach who uses his third and fourthstring players can give them vital ingame experience if he allows them to do more than in American football just quarterback kneel
Alternatively in college sports with many players from successful teams having hopes of becoming professionals running up the score gives players the chance to improve their statistics and to show off skills that the conventional offense would not allow While it may be seen as poor sportsmanship as there is no guarantee that any player will be picked for the professional leagues every opportunity to bolster stats and impress scouts can be seen as improving the professional prospects of the players

 Gameplay 
It is also argued that it can be used as a preventive measure to prevent a huge Comeback (sports)
 Improving tiebreaker qualification chances 
In addition many leagues use TiebreakerIn tournaments and playoffs
 Other justifications 
An argument frequently used in favor of running up the score is the belief that it is not the coachs or winning teams fault if a weak team is unable to stop a highpowered offensive juggernaut Florida State Seminoles football
Running up the score in professional leagues generally creates significantly less controversy and indeed the term is far less common While there are numerous reasons to run out the clock there is no reason not to score more points if the situation allows As all teams are professionals even perceived underdogs have the potential to score points quickly if they are given the chance Even teams with a dominant lead have a strong interest in maintaining possession to run down the clock which often puts them in the position to score more points

At all levels of play it is generally accepted that players or teams close to breaking significant records can run up the score without it being seen as overtly disrespectful In fact many offensive records almost require running up the score to be in contention as a result of records set in eras in which leagues were less balanced seasons were of a different length or rules were substantially different

In one instance that did not involve the score but where a longestablished record could have easily been broken a coach was praised for his sportsmanship In 1999 Cincinnati Bengals season

Florida
In 1995 with a 38–17 lead going into the fourth quarter over Georgia Florida head coach Steve Spurrier decided to run up the score to "hang half a hundred" on the scoreboard to humiliate their opponents on their home field something that had never been done before His team succeeded with a final score of 52–17 That record still stands as the most points ever scored by an opposing team at Sanford Stadium

Professional football
Running up the score is rarely done by teams in the National Football League (NFL) and other professional American football leagues A primary reason is that starting players and coaches are paid hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each year which is affected by how the players and the team performs during the season Any attempt to run up the score increases the risks of losing a key player to an injury that could affect the teams chances for the rest of the season Thus if a team decides to keep their stars in during a blowout it is usually viewed by the opponent as an insult Another factor is that the parity that the salary cap has brought to the NFL in the 1990s has evened out competition somewhat with less talent disparity between the best and worst teams compared to the past It is much more difficult to run up the score to embarrassing (50+ point) margins in the modern game at the pro level The greatest margin of victory at the professional level happened in the 1940 NFL Championship Game won by the Chicago Bears over the Washington Redskins 73–0 In 1976 the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Atlanta Falcons 59–0 a margin which was matched in 2009 when the New England Patriots defeated the Tennessee Titans in the New England snow Most recently the New Orleans Saints defeated the Indianapolis Colts 62–7 on October 23 2011; the Seattle Seahawks defeated the Arizona Cardinals 58–0 on December 9 2012; and the Miami Dolphins defeated the Denver Broncos 7020 on September 24 2023

The one exception to this general rule is in regards to the NFLs tiebreaking rules that are used to determine which teams qualify for the playoffs if they are tied in the standings One criterion to break ties is comparing the total number of points scored by each team during the regular season Under this scenario running up the score in a late season game is not considered poor sportsmanship because there is a benefit to having the score higher This scenario almost occurred during the 1999 season when the Green Bay Packers could possibly have made the playoffs if the Dallas Cowboys had lost and they had scored enough points against the division rival Cardinals in their final regular season game to surpass the Carolina Panthers in total points scored They ended up beating the Cardinals 49–24 but Dallas went on to beat the Giants later that day to earn the final playoff spot and knock the Packers out of the playoff picture anyway

Accusations of running up the score are unusual in the NFL (except in playoff races) but not unheard of One of the most notorious occurred on November 17 1985 when the New York Jets defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 62–28 in a regular season game The two teams had last met in the final game of 1984 NFL season
A game in 1996 between the Packers and Cowboys ended in a 21–6 Cowboys victory and some complaints by Green Bay players that the home teams final Field goal (football)
While some teams who regularly score very large number of points are occasionally criticized for running up the score it is debatable at exactly what point scoring additional points becomes running up the score Given recent comebacks such as The Miracle at the New Meadowlands and Super Bowl LI and how quickly points can be accumulated (through interception returns onside kicks and kick returns) it is understandable that coaches are cautious about becoming overconfident in their offenses and they normally prefer to run out the clock rather than risk an unlikely but certainly possible comeback late in the game particularly for teams who have a strong offense but a weaker defense

During the 2011 season the three teams with the best offenses (New England Green Bay and New Orleans) also had the worst defenses which explains why none of those teams were happy to run out the clock instead always pressuring for points The current salary cap rules mean that it is nearly impossible for a team to have an excellent offense and defense over any period of time particularly as cheaper players who play very well one year will likely cost more in the next year Such tactics are generally referred to as Keeping their foot on the gas and is generally not frowned upon in the NFL

The most egregious known case of running up the score in professional football is believed to have taken place in 1904 when the Massillon Tigers in the preforward pass era racked up 26 touchdowns and 18 extra points to amass a score of 148–0 against a team from Marion Ohio (Touchdowns only counted five points in this era) A similar rout had occurred in 1903 when the Watertown Red & Black obliterated an opponent from Cortland New York by a score of 142–0 Under thencurrent rules the team that had scored received the kickoff instead of kicking it as it is today; however it was much easier and more common to perform onside kicks in this era and as far as its known neither Marion nor Cortland attempted one As such neither team ever touched the ball after receiving the opening possession The thirdhighest total in professional football history is much more recent and happened in an indoor football game where scores tend to be much higher than in the traditional outdoor game In 2011 the Erie Explosion indoor football team racked up 138 points in a shutout victory over the Fayetteville Force (SIFL)
There is one definite instance of running up the score in NFL History In 1987 during the NFL strike the Dallas Cowboys had many starters cross the picket line such as Hall of Famers Randy White and Tony Dorsett and starting QB Danny White The Cowboys destroyed the Eagles 41–22 in one of the three strike games played in the 1987 season To get back at the Cowboys when the teams faced off again later in the season Coach Buddy Ryan called a passing play on 3rd down with 1:00 left to play in the game after taking a knee on first and second down even though the Eagles has the game won handily at a score of 30–20 The pass was incomplete but was called for pass interference moving the Eagles to the 1 yard line where the foul was called The Eagles then proceeded to score another touchdown and finish the game 37–20 Because both teams finished 7–8 and failed to make the playoffs that season this moment is not remembered as much as the 1987 Replacement game between the Washington Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys This moment was also overshadowed by the future success of the Eagles the Cowboys failures in the late 1980s and Buddy Ryans heavily publicized feud against his former coach Mike Ditka

In other sports

Basketball
In basketball some coaches of vastly superior teams team will keep in their starters in the latter stages of a grossly onesided game (eg less than ten minutes left in the second half of a college game; or well into the fourth quarter of a high school or National Basketball Association
A team that is trailing by an undefined margin sometimes may prolong the game by fouling the opponent on every possession in an effort to extend its chances of a comeback — although teams that utilize this strategy often do so only when the game is still somewhat competitive However this strategy does not always work particularly if the fouled players or team is able to connect on free throws

In cases where the score is lopsided much earlier in the game the most common option is to just "play it out" as if it were a scrimmage by trying to take the best shot possible and also attempt some sort of defense (without any taboos against fanpleasing shots and plays) This is usually referred to as "garbage time" and while generally frowned upon for a lack of excitement it is considered to be the best way of ending a thoroughly uncompetitive game with minimal amounts of pride lost by the weaker side

Running up the score was a key element in the Knicks–Nuggets brawl on December 16 2006 as New York Knicks
Former Oklahoma Sooners mens basketball
Occasionally teams will run up the score because of crowd encouragement Crowd encouragement can occur whether or not there is a physical incentive involved Often a crowd will start chanting "X more points" near the end of a game where X is the number of points needed to reach 100 This usually occurs when the team is within 5 points of reaching the 100point mark Also crowd encouragement can happen as the result of a promotion for ticketholders In a Bradley Braves mens basketball
Baseball
The unwritten rules of baseball discourage a team from sacrifice bunting stolen base
In a 2021 game where the visiting Chicago White Sox led the Minnesota Twins 154 late in the game the Twins put in Willians Astudillo a position utility player who normally would not pitch on the mound for the last inning a move traditionally seen under the games unwritten rules as conceding it to which batters customarily respond by not trying too hard to get hits so the game will end more quickly and without further humiliation to the losing team After Astudillo had gotten the first two White Sox batters out rookie catcher (baseball)
Amateur high school and international baseball games often have a mercy rule so that games end sooner when the lead is deemed to be insurmountable (eg by 10 runs after 5 innings) However since the home team always gets one final atbat if they are trailing the visiting team can in theory score unlimited runs in the top half of the inning

Cricket
The nature of cricket with teams alternating either one or two innings and how games are limited by time or overs means that running up the score does not exist as a meaningful term within the sport Teams seek to score the largest amount of runs within their specified time frame or before their wickets are taken by the opposition as long as the time taken to acquire the runs does not impact on the tactical considerations for winning the game In limited overs cricket rulesets such as One Day International and Twenty20 each team only get one chance to bat and have a set amount of overs to do so requiring the team batting first to post the largest run total they can product Teams may elect to play more aggressively due to conditions or with the aim of increasing their net run rate in the event a tiebreaker is required for further qualification within a tournament but these attempts may instead cause a team to give away their wickets making overly aggressive shots

In Test cricket and firstclass cricket with long hours of play per day and multiple days per match teams can accumulate runs for as long as they can avoid losing their wickets An excessive accumulation of runs by one team will increase the likelihood of a Draw (cricket)
Individual players may feel they have scored enough runs already during their innings and elect to Retired (cricket)
Curling
One of the unique rules of curling allows for the losing team to concede a match at any time thereby preventing blowout (sports)
Before teams were allowed to concede matches well before the normal end of the game blowouts were common

Ice hockey
In ice hockey complaints are quite rare for the simple reason that unless there is a gross disparity in skill teams generally do not score large numbers of goals at will against the opposition A mercy rule also may come into effect at prehighschool levels where such disparities might come into play as a matter of course Another tactic could be the coach of the leading team telling his team that everybody must touch the puck before a shot is taken

Lacrosse

High scores and wide margins of victory are not uncommon in field lacrosse While there is no mercy rule ending the game at a certain point in American high school lacrosse the game is played in running time with the clock stopped only for timeouts and injuries should one team open up a lead of 12 goals or more in the second half

Teams have been criticized for high scores at the expense of weak opponents In a 2019 college game NCAA Division II Colorado Mesa Mavericks
Sports Illustrated said it was "perhaps the most onesided game in the history of NCAA sports" rivaling the 1916 Cumberland vs Georgia Tech football game
Association football
In professional soccer the concept of "running up the score" is mostly unheard of; many league competitions use goal difference or goal average as a tiebreaker meaning there is incentive for a dominant side to win by as wide a margin of victory as possible Nevertheless large victory margins have sometimes been criticized in the womens game

The World Cup qualification match Australia 31–0 American Samoa saw Australia set the record for the largest victory in an international football match The vast gulf in quality was known well before the match began with Australia unhappy at having to play games against small Pacific Island nations with this and other lopsided contests contributing towards the reintroduction of a preliminary round for smaller teams in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and eventually the move of Australia out of the Oceanian confederation into the more competitive Asian Football Confederation

After the United States womens national soccer team
While former US star Hope Solo defended the outcome—"When you respect your opponent you dont all of a sudden sit back and try not to score"—she admitted that some of the celebrations particularly those that appeared planned "seemed a little overboard" She found in contrast the postgame embrace Carli Lloyd offered Thai goalkeeper Chor Charoenying after scoring the final goal in the 92nd minute to be more emblematic of the teams values

US coach Jill Ellis defended her players by noting both the importance of Goal difference
Ellis also suggested that sexism was at work wondering if as many questions about the scoring and celebrations would have been raised had a mens team won so dominantly However former US defender Alexi Lalas also now a television soccer analyst said "yes we would" He feared that the celebrations and the goals had cost the US team fans and "sealed themselves as villains" of the Cup

Australian rules football
There is no negative stigma associated with running up the score in Australian rules football as the sport lacks any obvious means to kill off a match quickly and painlessly and timewasting is both unpopular with fans and discouraged by the Laws of Australian rules football
The only tiebreaker used in most leagues is the goal average
American high school sports
Vast talent discrepancies between opponents happen more often in high school sports than in college or professional sports This is especially prevalent in district competition (where schools of similar size are grouped based on geography) and regional singleelimination tournaments in which all schools (regardless of record) participate It is even more prevalent in Kentucky high school basketball in which Sweet Sixteen (KHSAA State Basketball Championship)
One notorious example of many such incidents that happen each year throughout the United States was the stateranked Walkerville High School (enrollment 98) 115–2 victory against Lakeshore Academy (enrollment 49) in a Class D district game in the 2002 Michigan High School Girls Basketball state tournament

In light of similar incidents coaches are often accused of running up the score and taking the opportunity to humiliate and embarrass a weak opponent At times large margins of victory occur in games where the winning schools reserves (secondstring and junior varsity players) played a good share of the contest and simply were able to score at will against the weaker opposition However when the star players are left in to set scoring records as happened with Epiphanny Princes 113point basketball game in 2006 criticism usually follows

Since 2006 the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference has considered any victory margin of 50 points or more in a football game to be unsportsmanlike If this occurs the winning teams coach will be suspension (punishment)
During a 2007 Kansas State High School Activities Association playoff game Smith Center High School set a National Federation of State High School Associations record by scoring 72 points in the first quarter vs Plainville Coincidentally the same two teams played each other only 25 days prior to the playoff contest with Smith Center winning 72–0 During the regular season game a continuous clock was triggered when the score differential reached 40 points but there was no such provision in the rules at the time for its use in the playoffs Smith Center administrators called the KSHSAA office and received permission to use the running clock starting with the second quarter of the second game with Plainville (To avoid a recurrence in 2011 the KSHSAA adopted a modified mercy rule for the playoffs stating any 11man postseason contest prior to the championship game would use a running clock in the second half once the margin reached 45 points)

In October 2008 Naples High School defeated Estero High School Florida 91–0 Naples was the defending Florida High School Athletic Association Class 3A champion Despite accusations that Naples ran up the score Coach Bill Kramer kept most of his star players out of the game for most if not all of the game Some Naples parents consequently called the coach to complain that their sons did not play Five years later in 2013 another 91–0 score between district opponents Aledo High School (Texas)
In a January 13 2009 girls basketball game Covenant School of Dallas defeated Dallas Academy 100–0

In 1926 Haven High School of Haven Kansas defeated Sylvia High School by a score of 256–0 the highest recorded score in the history of American football

On January 5 2015 the San Bernardino Arroyo Valley (CA) High School girls basketball team obliterated Bloomington High by a score of 161–2 Ten days later San Bernardino suspended coach Michael Anderson for two games

On September 17 2021 the Coronado (CA) High School Football team smashed Kearny High with a score of 78–0 Coronado had a 41point first quarter setting a high score margin early in the game Kearny then continued their streak of losing by a large margin losing 760 during their next game against San Diego High on September 24

In an October 29 2021 football game Inglewood High School defeated Morningside High School by the lopsided score of 106–0 in a game that included 13 touchdown passes The California Interscholastic FederationSouthern Section condemned the contest and Inglewood Highs principal issued an apology Ironically in 1990 Morningside scored 102 points in the first half of a girls’ basketball game against South Torrance South Torrance refused to come back out after halftime to finish the game The final score was 102–24

Nonsporting examples
James Holzhauer was noted for his running up the score during his run on the game show Jeopardy! continuing to make aggressive wagers even after it was clear the game was a "runaway" victory (a term used by the Jeopardy! fanbase) where even if the other two contestants bet all their winnings in Final Jeopardy! they could not overcome Holzhauers muchlarger leading score at the end of Double Jeopardy! while Holzhauer merely needed to bet the difference between him and the secondplace winner minus $1

Holzhauer had a financial incentive to do so as winners take home the money they earn during the show and he went on to set several of the shows records for singlegame and singleweek earnings Running up the score is usually only possible in games where prizes are openended or where a games rules can be exploited to continuously win new opportunities to win additional money or prizes (as Michael Larson did in his 1984 Press Your Luck appearance; he had memorized the board to keep winning money that came with additional board spins) In games that operate on a point system while a score can still be run up there is less incentive to do so since the prize is fixed; most games that operate on a ladder or jackpot system for prizes cannot be run up
