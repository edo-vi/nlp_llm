The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World is a book by Pedro Domingos released in 2015 Domingos wrote the book in order to generate interest from people outside the field

Overview
The book outlines five approaches of machine learning: inductive reasoning connectionism evolutionary computation Bayes theorem and Analogical modeling
Towards the end of the book the author pictures a "master algorithm" in the near future where machine learning algorithms asymptotically grow to a perfect understanding of how the world and people in it work Although the algorithm doesnt yet exist he briefly reviews his own invention of the Markov logic network

In the media
In 2016 Bill Gates recommended the book alongside Nick Bostroms Superintelligence (book)
Reception
A computer science educator stated in Times Higher Education that the examples are clear and accessible In contrast The Economist agreed Domingos "does a good job" but complained that he "constantly invents metaphors that grate or confuse" Kirkus Reviews praised the book stating that "Readers unfamiliar with logic and computer theory will have a difficult time but those who persist will discover fascinating insights"

A New Scientist review called it "compelling but rather unquestioning"
