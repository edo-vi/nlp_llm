Projects
PICTURE C

PICTURE C stands for  Planetary Imaging Concept Testbed Using a Recoverable Experiment – Coronagraph NASA awarded Chakrabartis team a $56 million grant to develop and test PICTURE C It was the largest grant up to then The system potentially can detect young Jupitersize planets orbiting other sunlike stars in the Milky Way capable of supporting life by studying the disk of dust asteroids planets and other debris orbiting the stars and gain a better understanding of the processes and dynamics that formed solar system PICTURE C is carried aloft to the edge of Earths atmosphere using huge helium balloons Under Dr Chakrabarti PICTURE C made its first test flight in September 2019 The balloon lofted camera instrument inflates to  across and takes 3 hours to climb to an altitude of about  and then hovers The success of PICTUREC test launch makes spacebased direct imaging a reality and helps NASAs Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) with such technological support Members associated with the project are Supriya Chakraborti Timothy Cook Kuravi Hewawasam Susanna Finn and Christopher Mendillo Other collaborations were made from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory Goddard Space Flight Center Caltech MIT the Space Telescope Science Institute and the University of California Santa Barbara

Project Blue
Project Blue aims to design build and launch a small and lightweight space telescope to detect habitable planets around the nearest star Alpha Centauri LCSST team develops instrumentation for direct imaging of exoplanets in this project The project is also associated with The BoldlyGo Institute SETI Institute and Mission Centaur

SPACE HAUC project
The Science Program Around Communication Engineering with High Achieving Undergraduate Cadres Project or SPACE HAUC project provides multidisciplinary undergraduate students with handson training in designing and building spaceflight missions NASA released the Undergraduate Student Instrument Project (USIP) and Student Flight Research Opportunity (SFRO) in August 2015 and LCSST sent a proposal that was accepted under the program The project was selected in 2017 by NASAs CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) to be launched as part of the ELaNa program
Dr Chakrabarti mentors more than 75 The program is designed to demonstrate the practicality of communicating at high data rates in the X band 
SPACE HAUC was expected to launch in 2018 later postponed to 2020 The satellite has successfully passed design review and is under the testing phase After final assembly and integration of the spacecraft SPACE HAUC is expected launch to the ISS for further deployment
PICTURE B 
IMAGERII

Facilities 
The library contains source specific event files (gti and barycenter corrected) source images light curves (in three different energy bands titled soft broad and hard) spectra periodograms and pulse profiles on different projects It also contains data of six Xray telescope missions (~2000 pointed observations) namely XMMNewton RXTE Chandra NuSTAR NICER and Suzaku spanning across a period of two decades up until 2019 
An Astronomical Observatory is located on South Campus named UMass Lowell Schueller Observatory
