Interstitial art is any work of art the basic nature of which falls between rather than within the familiar boundaries of accepted genres or media thus making the work difficult to categorize or describe within a single artistic discipline

The concept of interstitiality

The word interstitial means "between spaces" and is commonly used to denote "inbetweenness" in several different cultural contexts Architects refer to the leftover gaps between building walls as "interstitial space" being neither inside any room nor outside the building Medical doctors have used  the term for hundreds of years to refer to a space within the human body that lies in between blood vessels and organs or in between individual cells Television station programmers refer to any short piece of content that is neither a show nor a commercial but is sandwiched between them as "an interstitial"

The interstitial arts movement

In the mid1990s Delia Sherman Ellen Kushner Terri Windling Heinz Insu Fenkl Midori Snyder Kelly Link Gavin Grant (editor)
Over a period of several years Kushner and Sherman prompted ongoing discussion about the importance of cultivating artistic "inbetweenness" led to the formulation of the broad concept of interstitial art In 2002 literary scholar Heinz Insu Fenkl founded ISIS: The Interstitial Studies Institute at the State University of New York at New Paltz and in 2003–04 Sherman & Kushner and some of their colleagues established the Interstitial Arts Foundation a 501(c)(3)
Interstitial arts projects
 Interfictions 
In 2007 the Interstitial Arts Foundation published an anthology of interstitial fiction through Small Beer Press titled Interfictions  It features 19 stories from new and established writers in the US Canada Australia and the UK and fiction translated from Spanish Hungarian and French  The anthology strives to "change your mind about what stories can and should do as they explore the imaginative space between conventional genres"

The anthology raised several questions and started many debates on the nature of interstitiality as applied to fiction  Reviewers raised the question of how important the definition or lack thereof was to understanding the anthology as a whole and the stories individually  "The 19 stories contained within Interfictions serve as examples but not as points of an argument that could lead to a listing in a Funk and Wagnalls"

Though many of the stories are written by science fiction fantasy and horror writers and contain fantastic or supernatural elements Interfictions is not a genre anthology  "interstitial fiction mixes and matches these precepts—ghost stories science fiction nursery rhymes detective story whatever may be handy—as part of a variegated prism to focus on the psychology of existence even while bending its collectively recognized state each interfiction shares this sense of disjointed narrative but in very different ways that do not lend themselves to easy genre categorization"
