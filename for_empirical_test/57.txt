File:Hannon_mapfrsvgPhoenician–Punic literature is literature written in Phoenician language
However it is a proven fact that both Phoenicia and Carthage had extensive libraries and that Phoenicians had a rich literary production inherited from their Canaanite past of which works by Philo of Byblos and Menander of Ephesus are only a small part

 History and sources 
File:Rutas_comerciales_feniciasessvgThe Jewish historian Josephus
Avienius

 Subjects 

 Agricultural treaties 
This is one of the areas where the most information is available since it is known that after the end of the Third Punic War the Roman Senate decided to translate an encyclopedic treaty on agronomy written by Mago  considered by Columella as the father of Agronomy  into Latin This treaty comprised 28 books  of which 66 fragments have been preserved It includes topics such as viticulture topography veterinary medicine beekeeping and fruit arboriculture as well as recommendations defending the idea that the properties should not be too large and that the owner should not be absent

Mago may not have been the only Carthaginian treatisist concerned with these topics since Columella clearly indicates that there were several other writers focusing on the subject However He does not specify who they might have been or the depth of their work  with the exception of one Amilcar

 Philosophical writings 
Philosophical works are likely to have been written even if there is little evidence since it is known that in Carthage as well as in Gadir there were Plato
 Religious writings 
The fragments of Sanchuniathons work that have been preserved form the most extensive religious text on Phoenician mythology known to date It is a kind of Theogony that includes passages on cosmogony heroic tales the life of the gods and the use of rituals with snakes There is also an allusion made by Plutarch in regards to a series of sacred scrolls rescued from Carthage and hidden underground although the veracity of this information has not been confirmed

 History treaties 
In The Histories (Polybius)
There are numerous allusions in Greek literature  until after 3 BC  to a Cosmogony written by Mochus! scope"col" style"width: 500px;"

 Language and grammar 
A Latin manuscript the Berne codex 123 suggests Phoenician had 12 Part of speech
 Navigation and geography treaties 
Although the Phoenicians were famous as navigators and explorers the only two accounts to have survived up to this day are the stories of Hanno the Navigator and Himilco Hannons original account seems to be no older than 2 BC thus raising the question of whether it was made when Carthage was destroyed Interestingly Greek and Latin historiography seemed to be completely unaware of this voyage before the fall of the Punic capital

Himilcons journey can be traced only to some comments made by Avienius which he claims come from ancient Punic records he might have accessed Another hypothesis is that King Juba II based his geographical knowledge of the Niles origins on Punic books that he kept at his court  as recorded by Ammianus Marcellinus
A similar thing applies to the voyages supposedly carried out by this monarch in the Canary Islands
 International and legislative treaties 
No direct information is available but there is evidence that the international treaties Rome signed with Carthage were kept in the Capitol on bronze tablets and it is to be presumed that the Punics preserved them as well The treaty signed in 215 BC by Hannibal and Philip V of Macedon is known to have been drafted in Greek and Punic and alluded to various Carthaginian divinities reminiscent of the treaty signed centuries before by Esarhaddon and the King of Tyre Lebanon
 Translated literature 
File:PlautusjpgMany classical authors  and even a few contemporary ones  have argued that in antiquity only the Romans were sufficiently educated to understand and translate Theatre of ancient Greece
With the rise of Carthage in the 5th century BC Phoenician became a prestigious language in the Mediterranean Sea
