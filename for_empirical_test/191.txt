Active immunization is the induction of immunity after exposure to an antigen antibody
Active immunization can occur naturally when  microbes or other antigen are received by a person who has not yet come into contact with the microbes and has no premade antibodies for defense The immune system will eventually create antibodies for the microbes but this is a slow process and if the microbes are dead there may not be enough time for the antibodies to be used
