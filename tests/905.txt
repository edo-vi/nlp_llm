The American Materia Medica Therapeutics and Pharmacognosy is a serious medical text from the early 20th century intended for practicing physicians and surgeons which refers to difficult medical situations found in that period There is an emphasis on physical diagnosis  The book is organized by organ system affected instead of by herbal name so it will have headings such as "agents acting on the nervous system" or "agents acting on the heart" This type of listing is somewhat controversial as herbal medicines tend to work on more than one system  The book had been substantially lost until it was scanned by herbalist Michael Moore (herbalist)
