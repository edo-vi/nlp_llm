Responses

The baring of Jacksons breast during the Super Bowl performance became referred to as a "wardrobe malfunction"

Following the Super Bowl both MTV and CBS apologized for the incident and asserted that they had no prior knowledge that Jackson and Timberlakes duet would involve partial nudity MTVs CEO Tom Freston claimed in an interview with the Reuters news agency that the exposure was a stunt orchestrated by Jackson However an MTV representative confirmed that the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff but added that nudity was not the intended result The incident was publicly criticized by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue Federal Communications Commission
Jacksons representative explained the incident saying "Justin was supposed to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed" According to Rolling Stone CBS required Jackson to make a public apology for the incident Regarding continued backlash she responded "Who knowsMaybe theyll get mad at something that I do in my show but at least it wont be new to me since Ive already gone through all of this But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine Everything happens for a reason"

Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman Jacksons outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen with Jackson later commenting "I dont blame him; he didnt rip it Alexander is so great at what he does—hes a genius" In January 2018 it was revealed that Jackson asked Marcello Garzon to alter the leather outfit she brought to Houston to wear during the halftime show and signed a confidentiality agreement before altering the garment

In an interview with Australias Herald Sun Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo (album)


Michael Musto of The Village Voice commented on the medias reaction to the incident saying "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake I actually do think her breast was used as a diversionary tactic—Im not sure to distract from Iraq War
Immediately following the incident Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions telling Access Hollywood "Hey man we love giving you all something to talk about" Timberlake later released a statement saying "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl It was not intentional and is regrettable" Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week saying "I know its been a rough week on everybody What occurred was unintentional completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended" Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated "All I could say was Oh my God Oh my God" Timberlake said "I looked at her They brought a towel up on stage They covered her up I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could Im frustrated at the whole situation Im frustrated that my character is being questioned"

Media diversion theories
Jackson suspected ulterior motives in the medias reaction expressing "It was just perfect timing to take peoples focus off of other things Thats what happens and it happened to me" The Boston Legal episode "Let Sales Ring" likened the incident to being used as a distraction portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone (magazine)
Powells response
A decade after the incident former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jacksons performance saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy including his own reaction was completely overblown Powell stated "I think weve been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on Part of it was surreal right? Look I think it was dumb to happen and they knew the rules and were flirting with them and my job is to enforce the rules but you know Really? This is what were gonna do? ⁠" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson who was lambasted for causing "an outrageous stunt" was unfair and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash "I personally thought that was really unfair" he said "It all turned into being about her In reality if you slow the thing down its Justin ripping off her breastplate"

Public reaction

United States
In the United States the exposure of Jacksons breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines The incident was sometimes referred to as "Nipplegate" The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement condemning the halftime show and called on PTC members to file indecency complaints with the FCC In addition the FCC received nearly 540000 complaints from Americans with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65000 of them (In its appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals CBS disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual nonorganized viewers) Columnist Phyllis Schlafly also expressed criticism of the halftime show in her weekly column Democratic Party (United States)
The Super Bowl controversy was also a subject of humor on latenight talk shows For example CBSs own Late Show with David Letterman mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl The day after the Super Bowl host David Letterman joked that he "was happy to see this thing happen&nbsp; because that meant for one night I wasnt the biggest Idiot (usage)
The halftime show continued to be a subject of discussion in 2005 The parody newspaper The Onion ran a lead article on January 26 2005 entitled "US Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV" The articles satirical target was the nations reaction to the incident rather than the incident itself On February 1 2005 exactly one year after the halftime show the PTC released a report titled MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex Drugs and Alcohol covering MTV programming during the networks "Spring Break" week from March 20 to 27 2004 accusing MTV of irresponsibly promoting sex drugs and alcohol to impressionable youth In response to the report MTV network executive Jeannie Kedas argued that the report "underestimates young peoples intellect and their level of sophistication" On February 6 The New York Times
Canada
In Canada where the Super Bowl telecast was broadcast by the Global Television Network the incident passed largely without controversy: only about 50 Canadians complained about the incident to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) The CBSC received roughly twice as many complaints about other aspects of the Super Bowl broadcast including music and advertising issues (though some were expected complaints about Canadian content/simultaneous substitution
New Zealand
New Zealand news outlets rebroadcast the "nipplegate" moment (some in slow motion) with commentary alleging that US ultraconservatives had made the incident into a major controversy The nations largest newspaper the New Zealand Herald ran an oped from a New Zealander living in America detailing his bafflement at his American friends who had expressed outrage at the glimpse of a nipple while supporting their countrys invasion of Iraq and being fans of the premium cable and adultrated HBO series Sex and the City

Legal action

On February 4 Terri Carlin a banker residing in Knoxville Tennessee filed a class action lawsuit against Jackson and Timberlake on behalf of "all American citizens who watched the outrageous conduct" The lawsuit alleged that the halftime show contained "sexually explicit acts solely designed to garner publicity and ultimately to increase profits for themselves" The lawsuit sought maximum punitive damages
AOL
File:Fcc complaints and fines 20012004JPGThe incident triggered a rash of fines that the FCC levied soon after the Super Bowl alleging that the context of the "wardrobe malfunction" was intended "to pander titillate and shock those watching" because it happened within the lyrics within Timberlakes performance of Rock Your Body: "Hurry up cause youre taking too long&nbsp; gonna have you naked by the end of this song" In addition the FCC cited a news article on MTVs website (MTVcom) claiming that the halftime show would promise "shocking moments" and that "officials of both CBS and MTV were well aware of the overall sexual nature of the Jackson/Timberlake segment and fully sanctioned it—indeed touted it as shocking to attract potential viewers" although in later statements CBS asserted that while the exposure was unplanned by CBS it was deliberately planned by Timberlake and Jackson "independently and clandestinely" On September 22 2004 the FCC fined Viacom the maximum penalty of US$27500 for each of the 20 CBSowned television stations (including broadcast relay stationsatellite stations
On November 24 2004 Viacom paid out US$35 million to settle outstanding indecency complaints and stated that it would challenge the US$550000 penalty related to the incident on the grounds that the broadcast was unintentional and thus exempt from indecency regulation In March 2006 the FCC affirmed that the Super Bowl halftime show was indecent so CBS paid the FCCs issued fine in July 2006 in order to take their appeal against their fine to federal court CBS appealed the fine on September 17 at the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
On July 21 2008 the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of CBS voiding the FCCs fine on the grounds that the enforcement involved a significant deviation from prior practice that was not issued as a clear policy change On May 4 2009 however the Supreme Court of the United States
On November 2 2011 the Third Circuit Court ruled 2–1 that its earlier decision was correct citing that the broadcast was legal under the FCCs thencurrent policy of allowing "fleeting" indecency on the airwaves and that it was unfair of the FCC to change the policy retroactively On June 29 2012 the Supreme Court declined an FCC appeal

Aftermath and effects

Censorship and regulation of broadcasting
Website Soap Opera Central speculated that the fallout from this incident may have had a subtle effect on daytime television These television shows are known for "Love in the Afternoon (advertising campaign)
Two other major sporting events that followed the Super Bowl that year also changed their respective halftime shows following the incident At the Pro Bowl which would be played on February 8 at Aloha Stadium in Hawaii singer JC Chasez a member of boy band N Sync as was Timberlake was to sing the StarSpangled Banner
Guiding Light edited out nudity from an episode that had already been taped A week later the shows executive producer John Conboy was fired and replaced by Ellen Wheeler All nine American network soaps began to impose an unwritten rule of avoiding any sort of risqué adult scenes and in the months following editors of soap opera periodical Soap Opera Digest wrote about how daytime television was losing its steam Even as late as Veterans Day (United States)
A petition was filed by a consortium of broadcasters (which included Viacom) and the RIAA over an FCC indecency ruling regarding fleeting expletives uttered by Bono of U2 when accepting an award at the 60th Golden Globe Awards in 2003 It argued that the FCC had implemented a standard "that would allow it to censor all kinds of things—anything considered blasphemous coarse or vulgar" and observed that many radio stations especially rock music
The incident also prompted tighter control over content by station owners and managers Viacom at the center of the controversy also employed the controversial Howard Stern in its radio division (at the time called Infinity Broadcasting) The expanding control on content is said to be a contributing factor that drove Stern away from terrestrial radio and onto Sirius Satellite Radio and is sometimes credited as the media figure most responsible for introducing a new era in radio Author Frederick S Lane stated in an interview with John Eggerton of Broadcasting & Cable magazine that the controversy surrounding the halftime show was the primary inspiration for his 2006 book The Decency Wars: The Campaign to Cleanse American Culture which explains moral controversies in the American media over the years

The NFL also came under some smaller controversies over its telecasts The FCC received a complaint about Foxs telecast of a January 2005 playoff game between the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings; the complainant alleged that Minnesota player Randy Moss who scored a touchdown apparently made movements appearing to mooning

Impact on Timberlake
People Magazine stated Timberlake was referred to as "the Teflon man" at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards because the incident did not affect him as it did Jackson In a 2006 interview with MTV Timberlake said that compared to the huge backlash Jackson suffered he himself received only about 10% of the blame; and he accused American society of being both "harsher on women" and "unfairly harsh on ethnic people" Prior to plans for the Super Bowl performance Jackson and Timberlake had discussed potentially recording a duet for Jacksons Damita Jo album as well as a rumored collaboration for a Quincy Jones album though neither came to fruition In November 2013 Timberlake performed a cover of Jacksons "Lets Wait Awhile" on The 20/20 Experience World Tour before transitioning into one of his song which was regarded as a sign of affection or apology to Jackson

Media commentators stated Jackson was treated too harshly by the media and public while Timberlakes career was not affected much by the incident Shannon L Holland in Womens Studies in Communication argued that the media reaction after the incident focused disproportionately on Jackson "representing her as a contemporary Stereotypes of African AmericansJezebel
One observer claimed "Despite her wardrobe malfunction—for which we think Justin Timberlake wasnt punished nearly as severely for—Janet put on a pretty amazing show" The New York Times noted "after her right breast upstaged the Super Bowl she was criticized by the first lady vilified by media executives and abandoned by her coconspirator Justin Timberlake; less excitable commentators suggested she was merely a shrewd publicitystunt woman with a new album to promote"

Timberlake would eventually be given a "second chance" being invited back to the Super Bowl halftime show when he was named headlining act for the Super Bowl LII halftime show in February 2018 During his performance Timberlake again sang a portion of "Rock Your Body" but stopped right before reaching the "Gonna have you naked by the end of this song" lyric saying "Hold up! Stop!" and smiling as a reference to the 2004 incident Timberlakes halftime show stint however received mixed reviews and ratings decline after losing more than 10 million viewers in the United States from the Super Bowl LI halftime show
On June 12 2009 in an interview with Entertainment Weekly Timberlake stated his biggest regret of the decade was not defending Janet Jackson more after the media backlash  "I wish I had supported Janet more I am not sorry I apologised but I wish I had been there more for Janet" he said

On February 12 2021 after social media backlash from the documentary Framing Britney Spears aired Timberlake publicly apologized to both Britney Spears and Janet Jackson in an Instagram post pledging to "take accountability" and that "I can do better and I will do better"
