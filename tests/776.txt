Context
Laws
In response to animal welfare and animal cruelty concerns a number of laws have passed regulating rodeo In the United Kingdom the Protection of Animals Act 1934 effectively made rodeo as it was then practiced illegal in England Scotland and Wales  In September 2000 California became the first American state to prohibit the use of prods on any animal in a chute

Independent assessments 
Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of animal cruelty by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo animals are to be managed

In 1994 a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by onsite independent veterinarians  Reviewing  animal runs the injury rate was documented 0047% (16 animals in 33991 runs

In 2000 a survey conducted by independent veterinarians at 57 PRCA rodeos found 0053% (38 animal injuries in 71743 animal exposures)

A 2001 survey reported an injury rate of 0056% in 21 PRCA rodeos (15 animals in 26584 performances)

A later PRCA survey of 60971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of "slack" (competitions outside of the main competition events) indicated 27 animals were injured ie 004%

In Australian rodeos similar injury rates occur  Basic injuries occur at a rate of 0072% (one in 1405) with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0036% (one injury each 2810 times an animal is used in competition)

Accusations of cruelty in US rodeos persist  The PRCA acknowledges they sanction only about 30% of all rodeos another 50% are sanctioned by other organizations and 20% are completely unsanctioned They cite various specific incidents of injury to support their statements and also point to examples of longterm breakdown as well as reporting on injuries and deaths suffered by animals in nonrodeo events staged on the periphery of professional rodeo such as Chuckwagon racing
Groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) note incidents of animal injury including an incident where a "bull  suffered from a broken neck" According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) practice sessions are often the scene of more severe animal welfare abuses than competitions

The Calgary Humane Society "opposes the use of animals for any form of entertainment in which they are placed at risk of suffering undue stress pain injury or death" and "opposes high risk rodeo events"

Vancouver Humane Society is "opposed to rodeo because most rodeo events involve the use of fear stress or pain to make animals perform There is also considerable risk of injury or death for the animals  "In Canada the City of Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver have banned rodeos"

RSPCA Australia is "opposed to rodeos and rodeo schools because of the potential for significant injury suffering or distress to the animals involved The use of painful devices such as flank straps spurs and electric prods contributes to suffering associated with this sport"
