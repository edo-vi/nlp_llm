Organization
File:Greg Norman 2014jpgThe early framework for a new golf tour to rival the PGA Tour became public in 2019 with announcement of a league to be known as the Premier Golf League PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan responded by implying that golfers who choose to play in a new league would be barred from PGA Tour events Later in 2020 the PGA European Tour and the PGA Tour formed a "strategic alliance" to work together on commercial opportunities scheduling and prize funds for each tours membership

In 2023 LIV Golf and the PGA announced that they will merge

The Premier Golf League held talks with Saudi investors about a financial partnership but Golf Saudi (a division of the Public Investment Fund) instead funded a new entity in 2020 which had its own plan to establish a global professional league

LIV Golf has often been described as the golfing equivalent to the dormant breakaway European Super League in football

In July 2022 LIV Golf formally applied to be included in the Official World Golf Ranking a process which typically takes between a year and two years from application submission to approval and awarding of OWGR points In October 2022 LIV Golf entered into a "strategic alliance" with the MENA Tour The arrangement was conceived in order to immediately afford LIV Golf events ranking points; however it was subsequently confirmed that events in 2022 would not receive points as changes to the MENA Tour would need to be reviewed

Format 
The inaugural season of the LIV Golf Invitational Series featured eight 54hole nocut stroke play tournaments and a final Team Championship set to be a "seeded fourday fourround match play knockout" event held at Trump National Doral Miami in October 2022

In June 2022 it was reported that LIV Golf would evolve the following year into a league format with a 14event schedule and 48 contracted players On 27 July 2022 Norman announced that LIV Golf would implement a promotion and relegation system featuring a rankings list and a fourplayer relegation out of the 48 contracted players The league has a prize fund of $405 million Its events are scheduled to avoid conflicting with Mens major golf championships
