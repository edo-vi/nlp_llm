History

The farces; critical reception
The five farces were as follows:
! Title !! Author!! Premiere!! Closed!! Performances

Rix built a company of regular players who appeared in some or all of these shows They included Leo Franklyn Larry Noble Dennis Ramsden and Derek Royle and members of Rixs family: his wife Elspet Gray his sister Sheila Mercier and his brotherinlaw Peter Mercier Others who appeared in one or more of the Whitehall farces include Terry Scott and Andrew Sachs Rix starred in all five plays in a range of roles: a "gormless recruit" to the army in Reluctant Heroes; a timidly crooked bookies runner in Dry Rot; a street musician recruited as a secret agent in Simple Spymen; four identical brothers in One For the Pot; and a harassed civil servant in Chase Me Comrade From Dry Rot onwards Rix and his authors developed a double act for the Rix characters and those played by Leo Franklyn in which the two performers played off one another rather as Ralph Lynn and Tom Walls had done in the Aldwych farces of the previous generation

Although the five plays constituting the Whitehall farces had long runs and the theatres usually had full houses the majority of London critics were dismissive of them Writing in the Financial Times in 1980 Michael Coveney commented: "A tradition of critical snobbery has grown up around these plays partly because they were so blatantly popular but chiefly because of our conviction that farce unless written by a Frenchman is an inferior theatrical species Once the Royal National Theatre
Television broadcasts; later productions
In addition to the five longrunning farces Rix presented a series of more than eighty oneoff televised comedies some of them farces for the BBC The first was transmitted live from the Whitehall Theatre in January 1956 There were also film versions of Reluctant Heroes (1951) Dry Rot (film)
In 1966 having been unable to secure the lease of the Whitehall Theatre Rix took his company on tour in Chase Me Comrade and Bang Bang Beirut (later retitled Stand By Your Bedouin) by Cooney and Hilton Later productions by the Rix company at the Garrick Theatre and elsewhere included Uproar in the House (1967) by Anthony Marriott and Alistair Foot; Let Sleeping Wives Lie (also 1967) by Harold Brooke and Kay Bannerman; Shes Done It Again (play)
