Cocooning also known as the Cocoon Strategy is a vaccination strategy to protect infants and other vulnerable individuals from infectious diseases by vaccinating those in close contact with them If the people most likely to transmit an infection are Immunity (medical)
Cocooning is especially commonly used for pertussis It aims to protect newborn infants from becoming infected with pertussis by administering DTaP/Tdap (tetanus diphtheria and acellular pertussis) booster vaccine to parents family members and any individuals who would come into regular contact with the newborn infant By vaccinating these individuals with a pertussis booster a pool of persons is established around the newborn who are themselves protected from getting pertussis and passing it on to the infant thereby creating a "cocoon" of protection around the newborn Young infants have the highest rate of pertussis; in 87100% of all deaths caused by pertussis the victim is an infant of less than 6 months of age too young to have finished acquiring vaccineinduced immunity Adolescents and young adults whose immunity has just worn off are often infected but very unlikely to die They can however infect others 35% to 68% of infants infected with pertussis are infected by a close contact most commonly the mother Cocooning prevents about 20% of infant pertussis cases; vaccination during pregnancy prevents more (33%)

Rationale
File:HumanNewbornJPG
Some people cannot be fully protected from vaccinepreventable diseases by direct vaccination These are often people with weak immune systems who are more likely to get seriously ill Their risk of infection can be significantly reduced if those who are most likely to infect them get the appropriate vaccines

Vaccination works by training the immune system to react promptly to an infection warding off illness (acquired immunity) People with weak immune systems may have difficulty acquiring and retaining immunity

A babys immune system is not yet fully developed Babies are more likely to have serious complications or die from diseases even diseases that have milder effects in adults Breastfeeding also offers protection but is not as effective as vaccination at preventing some diseases

Some people have immunocompromised
Some vaccines require multiple doses spaced over time to be effective Those who have not yet received all the doses (including all young babies) are not yet fully immune and rely on the immunity of those around them Some vaccines also require booster shots
Some people are also unable to take some vaccines due to an allergy
Recommendations and use

Cocooning is widely recommended Cocooning for pertussis has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States since 2006 The World Health Organization the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the Global Pertussis Initiative and the Public Health Agency of Canada all recommend cocooning against pertussis
