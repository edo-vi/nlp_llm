Competing theories of the cause of the Late Bronze Age collapse have been proposed since the 19th century with most involving the violent destruction of cities and towns These include volcanic eruptions droughts disease invasions by the Sea Peoples or Dorian invasion
 Collapse 
 

Cultural destruction

The half century between  and 1150 BC saw the cultural collapse of the Mycenaean Greece
Only a few powerful states survived the Bronze Age collapse particularly Assyria (albeit temporarily weakened) the New Kingdom of Egypt (also weakened) the Phoenician citystates and Elam Even among these comparative survivors success was mixed By the end of the 12th century Elam waned after its defeat by Nebuchadnezzar I who briefly revived Babylonian fortunes before suffering a series of defeats by the Assyrians After the death of Ashurbelkala in 1056 Assyria declined for a century Its empire shrank significantly by 1020 BC apparently leaving it in control only of the areas in its immediate vicinity although its heartland remained welldefended By the time of Wenamun Phoenicia had regained independence from Egypt

City destruction
Initially historians believed that in the first phase of this period almost every city between Pylos and Gaza City
However more recent research has shown that Drews overestimated the number of cities that were destroyed and referenced destructions that never happened According to Millek <blockquote>"If one goes through archaeological literature from the past 150 years there are 148 sites with 153 destruction events ascribed to the end of the Late Bronze Age ca 1200 BC However of these 94 or 61% have either been misdated assumed based on little evidence or simply never happened at all For Drewss map and his subsequent discussion of some other sites which he believed were destroyed ca 1200 BC of the 60 "destructions" 31 or 52% are false destructions The complete list of false destructions includes other notable sites such as: Lefkandi Orchomenos Athens Knossos Alassa Carchemish Aleppo Alalakh Hama Qatna Kadesh Tell Tweini Byblos Tyre Sidon Ashdod Ashkelon BethShean Tell Dier Alla and many more"</blockquote>

Ann Killebrew has shown that cities such as Jerusalem were large and important walled settlements in the preIsraelite
Bronze Age
Causes
Various explanations for the collapse have been proposed including climatic changes (such as drought or effects of volcanic eruptions) invasions by groups such as the Sea Peoples effects of the spread of iron metallurgy developments in military weapons and tactics and a variety of failures of political social and economic systems but none has achieved consensus It is likely that a combination of several of these factors is responsible

Dating
The reason why the arbitrary date 1200 BC acts as the beginning of the end of the Late Bronze Age derives from one German historian Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren In one of his histories on ancient Greece from 1817 Heeren stated that the first period of Greek prehistory ended around 1200 BC basing this date on the fall of Troy at 1190 after ten years of war He then went on in 1826 to date the End of the 19th Dynasty
Later cultural memories of the collapse
Cultural memories of the disaster told of a "lost golden age" For example Hesiod spoke of Ages of Gold Silver and Bronze separated from the cruel modern Age of Iron by the Greek Heroic Age
Evaluation
Robert Drews described the collapse as "arguably the worst disaster in ancient history even more calamitous than the collapse of the Western Roman Empire"

Recovery

Gradually by the end of the ensuing Dark Age remnants of the Hittites coalesced into small SyroHittite states in Cilicia and in the Levant where the new states were composed of mixed Hittite and Arameans
Regional evidence


Evidence of destruction

Anatolia
File:Hittites 1300bcjpg
Before the Bronze Age collapse Anatolia (Asia Minor) was dominated by a number of peoples of varying ethnolinguistic origins including: Semitic languages
From the 16th century BC the Mitanni a migratory minority speaking an IndoAryan language formed a ruling class over the Hurrians Similarly the IndoEuropeanspeaking Hittites absorbed the Hattians a people speaking a language that may have been of the nonIndoEuropean North Caucasian languages or a language isolate

Every Anatolian site apart from integral Assyrian regions in the southeast and regions in eastern central and southern Anatolia under the control of the powerful Middle Assyrian Empire (1392–1050) that was important during the preceding Late Bronze Age shows a destruction layer and it appears that in these regions civilization did not recover to the level of the Assyrians and Hittites for another thousand years or so The Hittites were already weakened by a series of military defeats and annexations of their territory by the Middle Assyrian Empire which had already destroyed the HurrianMitanni Empire It was initially thought that they then suffered a coup de grâce when Hattusa the Hittite capital was burned — perhaps by the Kaskians long indigenous to the southern shores of the Black Sea aided by the incoming IndoEuropeanspeaking Phrygians However Jürgen Seeher the former lead excavator at Hattusa has demonstrated that the city was not completely destroyed in a single catastrophic assault He states that:<blockquote>1) There is no burnt horizon only a certain number of burnt ruins the date of whose destruction is not established; 2) for the most part these burnt ruins contained no finds which suggests that they burnt down only after they had lost their function and had been emptied of artefacts; 3) the emptying was presumably carried out by inhabitants of the city  – after all an enemy that is attacking a city does not go to the trouble of emptying buildings virtually down to the last pot before torching them; 4) the only buildings to have burnt are official ones – temples  palace buildings – while the residential districts remained unscathed; this too argues against an assault from outside</blockquote>Karaoğlan near presentday Ankara was burned and the corpses left unburied Many other sites that were not destroyed were abandoned The Luwian city of Troy famed site of the Trojan War was destroyed at least twice in this period before being abandoned until Roman Empire
The Phrygians had arrived probably through the Bosporus or over the Caucasus Mountains in the 13th century before being first stopped by the Assyrians and then conquered by them in the Early Iron Age of the 12th century Other groups of IndoEuropean peoples followed the Phrygians into the region most prominently the Dorians and Lydians and in the centuries after the period of Bronze Age Collapse Cimmerians and the Iranianspeaking Scythians also appeared Semiticspeaking Arameans and Kartvelianspeaking Colchians and revived Hurrian polities particularly Urartu Nairi and Shupria also emerged in parts of the region and Transcaucasia The Assyrians continued their extant policies conquering the new peoples and polities they came into contact with as they had with the preceding polities of the region However Assyria gradually withdrew from much of the region for a time in the second half of the 11th century although they continued to campaign militarily at times in order to protect their borders and keep trade routes open until a renewed vigorous period of expansion in the late 10th century

These sites in Anatolia show evidence of the collapse:
 Troy
 Miletus
 Hattusa
 Mersin
 Tarḫuntašša

Cyprus

During the reign of the Hittite king Tudḫaliya IV (reigned c 1237–1209) the island was briefly invaded by the Hittites either to secure the copper resource or as a way of preventing piracy Shortly afterwards the island was reconquered by his son Suppiluliuma II around 1200

There is little evidence of destruction on the island of Cyprus in the years surrounding 1200 which marks the separation between the Prehistoric Cyprus
Several settlements on Cyprus were abandoned at the end of the LC IIC or during the first half of the 12th century without destruction such as Pyla Kokkinokremmos Toumba tou Skourou Alassa and MaroniVournes

Syria

Ancient Syria had been initially dominated by a number of indigenous Semitic languages
Before and during the Bronze Age Collapse Syria became a battleground between the Hittites the Middle Assyrian Empire the Mitanni and the New Kingdom of Egypt between the 15th and late 13th centuries BC with the Assyrians destroying the HurriMitanni empire and annexing much of the Hittite empire The Egyptian empire had withdrawn from the region after failing to overcome the Hittites and being fearful of the evergrowing Assyrian might leaving much of the region under Assyrian control until the late 11th century Later the coastal regions came under attack from the Sea Peoples During this period from the 12th century the incoming Northwest Semiticspeaking Arameans came to demographic prominence in Syria the region outside of the Canaanitespeaking Phoenician coastal areas eventually came to speak Aramaic and the region came to be known as Aramea and Eber Nari

The Babylonians belatedly attempted to gain a foothold in the region during their brief revival under Nebuchadnezzar I in the 12th century but they too were overcome by their Assyrian neighbors The modern term "Syria" is a later IndoEuropean corruption of "Assyria" which only became formally applied to the Levant during the Seleucid Empire (323–150 BC) (see Etymology of Syria)

Levantine sites previously showed evidence of trade links with Mesopotamia (Sumer Akkad (region)
A letter by the king is preserved on one of the clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city Ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many Levantine states due to attacks In response to a plea for assistance from the king of Alasiya Ammurapi highlights the desperate situation Ugarit faced in letter RS 18147:



Eshuwara the senior governor of Cyprus responded in letter RS 2018:



The ruler of Carchemish sent troops to assist Ugarit but Ugarit was sacked Letter RS 19011 (KTU 261) sent from Ugarit following the destruction said:



This quote is frequently interpreted as "the degraded one " referring to the army being humiliated destroyed or both The letter is also quoted with the final statement "Mayst thou know it"/"May you know it" repeated twice for effect in several later sources while no such repetition appears to occur in the original

The destruction levels of Ugarit contained Late Helladic IIIB ware but no LH IIIC (see Mycenaean Greece) Therefore the date of the destruction is important for the dating of the LH IIIC phase Since an Egyptian sword bearing the name of Pharaoh Merneptah was found in the destruction levels 1190 was taken as the date for the beginning of the LH IIIC A cuneiform tablet found in 1986 shows that Ugarit was destroyed after the death of Merneptah It is generally agreed that Ugarit had already been destroyed by the 8th year of Ramesses III 1178 Letters on clay tablets that were baked in the conflagration caused by the destruction of the city speak of attack from the sea and a letter from Alashiya (Cyprus) speaks of cities already being destroyed by attackers who came by sea

There is clear evidence that Ugarit was destroyed in some kind of assault though the exact assailant is not known In one residential area called the Ville sud thirty two arrowheads were found scattered throughout the area while 12 of the arrowheads were found on the streets and in the open spaces Along with the arrowheads two lance heads four javelin heads five bronze daggers one bronze sword and three bronze pieces of armor were scattered throughout the houses and streets suggesting a fight took place in this residential neighborhood An additional twenty five arrowheads were also recovered scattered around the Centre de la ville all of which suggests the city was burnt by an assault not by an earthquake At the city of Emar on the Euphrates at some time between 1187 and 1175 only the monumental and religious structures were targeted for destruction while the houses appear to have been emptied abandoned and were not destroyed with the monumental structures which suggests that the city was burned by attackers even though no weapons were recovered

While certain cities such as Ugarit and Emar were destroyed at the end of the Late Bronze Age there are several others which were not destroyed even though they erroneously appear on most maps of destruction from the end of the Late Bronze Age No evidence of destruction has been found at Hama Qatna Kadesh Alalakh and Aleppo while for Tell Sukas archaeologists only found some minor burning on some floors likely indicating that the town was not burned to the ground around 1200 BC

Southern Levant
Egyptian evidence shows that from the reign of Horemheb (ruled either 1319 or 1306 to 1292) wandering Shasu were more problematic than the earlier Apiru Ramesses II (r 1279–1213) campaigned against them pursuing them as far as Moab where he established a fortress after a near defeat at the Battle of Kadesh During the reign of Merneptah the Shasu threatened the "Via Maris
There is little evidence that any major city or settlement in the southern Levant was destroyed around 1200 At Lachish The Fosse Temple III was ritually terminated while a house in Area S appears to have burned in a house fire as the most severe evidence of burning was next to two ovens while no other part of the city had evidence of burning After this though the city was rebuilt in a grander fashion than before For Megiddo most parts of the city did not have any signs of damage and it is only possible that the palace in Area AA might have been destroyed though this is not certain However many sites were not burned to the ground around 1200 including: Ashkelon Ashdod Tell esSafi Tel Batash Tel Burna Tel Dor Tel Gerisa Tell Jemmeh Khirbet Rabud Tel Zeror and Tell Abu Hawam among others

During the reign of Ramesses III Philistines were allowed to resettle the coastal strip from Gaza to Joppa Denyen (possibly the tribe of Dan in the Bible or more likely the people of Adana also known as Danuna part of the Hittite Empire) settled from Jaffa
Despite many theories which claim that trade relations broke down after 1200 in the southern Levant there is ample evidence that trade with other regions continued after the end of the Late Bronze Age in the Southern Levant Archaeologist Jesse Millek has shown that while the common assumption is that trade in Cypriot and Mycenaean pottery ended around 1200 trade in Cypriot pottery actually largely came to an end at 1300 while for Mycenaean pottery this trade ended at 1250 and destruction around 1200 could not have affected either pattern of international trade since it ended before the end of the Late Bronze Age He has also demonstrated that trade with Egypt continued after 1200 Archaeometallurgical studies performed by various teams have also shown that trade in tin a nonlocal metal necessary to make bronze did not stop or decrease after 1200 even though the closest source of the metal were modern Afghanistan Kazakhstan or perhaps even Cornwall England Lead from Sardinia was still being imported to the southern Levant after 1200 during the early Iron Age

These sites in the Southern Levant show evidence of the collapse:
 Tel Hazor Akko
 Tel Megiddo Deir Alla (Sukkot (place) Bethel
 Beth Shemesh
 Lachish
 Ashdod
 Ashkelon

Greece


Destruction was heaviest at palaces and fortified sites and none of the Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age survived (with the possible exception of the Cyclopean fortifications on the Acropolis of Athens) Thebes was one of the earliest examples of this having its palace sacked repeatedly between 1300 and 1200 and eventually completely destroyed by fire The extent of this destruction is highlighted by Robert Drews who reasons that the destruction was such that Thebes did not resume a significant position in Greece until at least the late 12th century Many other sites offer less conclusive causes; for example it is unclear what happened at Athens although it is clear that the settlement saw a significant decline during the Bronze Age Collapse While there is no evidence of remnants of a destroyed palace or central structure a change in location of living quarters and burial sites demonstrates a significant recession Furthermore the increase in fortification at this site suggests much fear of the decline in Athens Vincent Desborough asserts that this is evidence of later migrations away from the city in reaction to its initial decline although a significant population did remain It remains possible that this emigration from Athens was not flight from violence Nancy Demand posits that environmental changes could have played an important role in the collapse of Athens In particular Demand notes the presence of "enclosed and protected means of access to water sources at Athens" as evidence of persistent droughts in the region that could have resulted in a fragile reliance on imports
File:TírynsjpgUp to 90% of small sites in the Peloponnese were abandoned suggesting a major depopulation Again as with many of the sites of destruction in Greece it is unclear how a lot of this destruction came about The city of Mycenae for example was initially destroyed in an earthquake in 1250 as evidenced by the presence of crushed bodies buried in collapsed buildings Drews points out that there was continued occupation at these sites accompanied by attempts to rebuild demonstrating the continuation of Tiryns as a settlement Demand suggests instead that the cause could again be environmental particularly the lack of homegrown food and the important role of palaces in managing and storing food imports implying that their destruction only stood to exacerbate the more crucial factor of food shortage The importance of trade as a factor is supported by  who points out the lack of evidence for violent or sudden decline in Mycenae

Pylos offers some more clues to its destruction as the intensive and extensive destruction by fire around 1180 reflects the violent destruction of the city There is some evidence of Pylos expecting a seaborne attack with tablets at Pylos discussing "Watchers guarding the coast" Eric Cline rebuts the idea that this is evidence of an attack by Sea People pointing out that the tablet does not say what is being watched for or why Cline does not see naval attacks as playing a role in Pyloss decline Demand however argues that regardless of what the threat from the sea was it likely played a role in the decline at least in hindering trade and perhaps vital food imports

The Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the Greek Dark Ages which lasted roughly 400 years and ended with the establishment of Archaic Greece Other cities such as Athens continued to be occupied but with a more local sphere of influence limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture from which it took centuries to recover

Areas that survived
Mesopotamia
The Middle Assyrian Empire (1392–1056) had destroyed the HurrianMitanni Empire annexed much of the Hittite Empire and eclipsed the Egyptian Empire At the beginning of the Late Bronze Age collapse it controlled an empire stretching from the Caucasus mountains in the north to the Arabian peninsula in the south and from Ancient Iran in the east to Cyprus in the west However in the 12th century Assyrian satrapies in Anatolia came under attack from the Mushki (who may have been Phrygians) and those in the Levant from Arameans but TiglathPileser I (reigned 1114–1076 BC) was able to defeat and repel these attacks conquering the attackers The Middle Assyrian Empire survived intact throughout much of this period with Assyria dominating and often ruling Babylonia directly and controlling southeastern and southwestern Anatolia northwestern Iran and much of northern and central Syria and Canaan as far as the Mediterranean Sea
The Arameans and Phrygians were subjugated and Assyria and its colonies were not threatened by the Sea Peoples who had ravaged Egypt and much of the East Mediterranean and the Assyrians often conquered as far as Phoenicia and the East Mediterranean However after the death of Ashurbelkala in 1056 Assyria withdrew to areas close to its natural borders encompassing what is today northern Iraq northeastern Syria the fringes of northwestern Iran and southeastern Turkey It still retained a stable monarchy the best army in the world and an efficient civil administration enabling it to survive the Bronze Age Collapse intact Assyrian written records remained numerous and the most consistent in the world during the period and the Assyrians were still able to mount long range military campaigns in all directions when necessary From the late 10th century Assyria once more asserted itself internationally and the NeoAssyrian Empire grew to be the largest the world had yet seen

The situation in Babylonia was very different After the Assyrian withdrawal it was still subject to periodic Assyrian (and Elamite) subjugation and new groups of Semitic speakers such as the Aramaeans
Egypt

File:Medinet Habu Ramses III Tempel Nordostwand Abzeichnung 01jpgWhile it survived the Bronze Age collapse the Egyptian Empire of the New Kingdom of Egypt
The Nubian War the First Libyan War the Northern War and the Second Libyan War were all victories for Ramesses Due to this however the economy of Egypt fell into decline and state treasuries were nearly bankrupt By defeating the Sea People Libyans and Nubians the territory around Egypt was safe during the collapse of the Bronze Age but military campaigns in Asia depleted the economy With his victory over the Sea People Ramesses III stated "My sword is great and mighty like that of Montu No land can stand fast before my arms I am a king rejoicing in slaughter My reign is calmed in peace" With this claim Ramesses implied that his reign was safe in the wake of the Bronze Age collapse

File:EastHem 1000bcjpgEgypts withdrawal from the southern Levant was a protracted process lasting some one hundred years and was most likely a product of the political turmoil in Egypt proper Many Egyptian garrisons or sites with an "Egyptian governors residence" in the southern Levant were abandoned without destruction including Dier elBalah Ashkelon Tel Mor Tell elFarah (South) Tel Gerisa Tell Jemmeh Tel Masos and Qubur elWalaydah Not all Egyptian sites in the southern Levant were abandoned without destruction The Egyptian garrison at Aphek was destroyed likely in an act of warfare at the end of the 13th century The Egyptian gate complex uncovered at Jaffa was destroyed at the end of the 12th century between 1134 and 1115 based on C14 dates while BethShean was partially though not completely destroyed possibly by an earthquake in the mid12th century

Possible causes
Various theories have been put forward as possible contributors to the collapse many of them mutually compatible

Environmental
Volcanoes

Some Egyptologists have dated the Hekla 3 eruption
Other estimated dates for the Hekla 3 eruption range from 1021 (±130) to 1135 BC (±130) Other scholars prefer the neutral and vague "3000 Before Present
 Drought 
During what may have been the driest era of the Late Bronze Age tree cover of the Mediterranean forest dwindled Primary sources report that the era was marked by Premodern human migration
In the Dead Sea region (The Southern Levant) the subsurface water level dropped by more than 50 meters during the end of the second millennium BC According to the geography of that region for water levels to drop so drastically the amount of rain the surrounding mountains received would have been dismal

Drought in the Nile Valley also may have contributed to the rise of the Sea Peoples and their sudden migration across the eastern Mediterranean It was suspected that crop failures famine and the population reduction that resulted from the lackluster flow of the Nile and the migration of the Sea Peoples led to New Kingdom Egypt falling into political instability at the end of the Late Bronze Age and well into the Iron Age

Using the Palmer Drought Index for 35 Greek Turkish and Middle Eastern weather stations it was shown that a drought of the kind that persisted from January 1972 AD would have affected all of the sites associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse Drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socioeconomic problems and led to wars

In 2012 it was suggested that the diversion of midwinter storms from the Atlantic to north of the Pyrenees and the Alps bringing wetter conditions to Central Europe but drought to the Eastern Mediterranean was associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse Alternatively changes at the end of the Bronze Age could be better characterized as a gear shift in Mediterranean climate rather than an event of three years The longrange shift in precipitation would not have been a crisis event but rather a continual stress put on human societies in the region for several generations There was no one year where conditions became untenable "nor one straw that broke the back of the camel" Analysis of multiple lines of Paleoecology
Pandemic
Recent evidence suggests the collapse of the cultures in Mycenaean Greece Hittite Anatolia and the Levant may have been precipitated or worsened by the arrival of an early and nowextinct strain of the Bubonic Plague that was brought from central Asia by the Sea Peoples or other migrating groups

Cultural

Ironworking
The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow spread of ironworking technology from presentday Bulgaria and Romania in the 13th and the 12th centuries BC

Leonard R Palmer suggested that iron (material)
Changes in warfare

Robert Drews argues for the appearance of massed infantry using newly developed weapons and armour such as Casting (metalworking)
Such new weaponry in the hands of large numbers of "running skirmishers" who could swarm and cut down a chariot army would destabilize states that were based upon the use of chariots by the ruling class That would precipitate an abrupt social collapse as raiders began to conquer loot and burn cities

General systems collapse

A general systems collapse has been put forward as an explanation for the reversals in culture that occurred between the Urnfield culture of the 13th and 12th centuries BC and the rise of the Celtic Hallstatt culture in the 9th and 10th centuries BC General systems collapse theory pioneered by Joseph Tainter proposes that societal collapse results from an increase in social complexity beyond a sustainable level leading people to revert to simpler ways of life

In the specific context of the Middle East a variety of factorsincluding population growth soil retrogression and degradation
The growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political economic and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conants phrase together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and rendered the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralization specialization complexity and topheavy political structure These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries) fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean Hittite Ugaritic and Egyptian) demographic crises (overpopulation) and wars between states Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include piracy by the Sea Peoples interrupting maritime trade as well as drought crop failure famine or the Dorian invasion
