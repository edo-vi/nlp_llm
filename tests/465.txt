The Early Prostate Cancer (EPC) programme was a large clinical trial programme of monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide (Casodex) plus standard care versus standard care alone in men with early prostate cancer

The three trials in the EPC programme were as follows:

 Trial 23 (North America; n3292)
 Trial 24 (Europe Australia Israel South Africa and Mexico; n3603)
 Trial 25 (Scandinavia; n1218) (also known as the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group6 (SPCG6) study)

Several combined followup papers of the EPC programme results were published including at median 30years in August 2002 median 54years in November 2004 median 74years in February 2006 and median 97years in April 2010

The EPC programme found that bicalutamide was effective in treating locally advanced prostate cancer Conversely it was not effective for localized prostate cancer where there was instead a statistical significance
Liver safety is an important concern with bicalutamide In the first analysis of the EPC programme at median 30years of followup abnormal liver function tests had occurred in 34% of men treated with bicalutamide and 19% of men with placebo Clinically relevant increases in aspartate transaminase (AST) alanine transaminase (ALT) and bilirubin occurred in 16% 16% and 07% with bicalutamide and in 05% 03% and 04% with placebo However liver changes with bicalutamide were usually transient and rarely severe Abnormal liver function tests led to treatment withdrawal in 14% with bicalutamide and 05% with placebo No cases of fatal hepatotoxicity occurred with bicalutamide in the SPCG6 substudy of the EPC programme
