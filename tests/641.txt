Clandestine literature also called "underground literature" refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves selfpublishing works often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship prosecution or other suppression In academic study such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications (as opposed to officially sanctioned orthodox publishing)
Examples
Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents; the Aljamiado literature of AlAndalus Spain; and the nushu writing of some upperclass women in Hunan China from around the 10th century to the 19th century Clandestine publications were plentiful during the French Enlightenment
Another notable example of clandestine literature is Bruce BethkePurpose and process
The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power but also for reasons at a formal level when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs often being funded by the authors themselves

Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature such as Das Kapital and El Busc√≥n

A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20thcentury Englishlanguage writers including Henry Miller who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time
