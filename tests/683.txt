Protests during the playing of the United States national anthem have had many causes including civil rights anticonscription antiwar antinationalism and religious reservations Such protests have occurred since at least the 1890s well before "The StarSpangled Banner" was adopted and resolved by Congress as the official national anthem in 1916 and 1931 respectively Earlier protests typically took place during the performance of various unofficial national anthems including "My Country Tis of Thee" and "Hail Columbia" These demonstrations may include refusal to stand or face the American flag during the playing of the Anthem Some of the protestors object to honoring the slaveowner and author of the lyrics Francis Scott Key

On political grounds
Early examples
In 1892 three men including a friend of Ida B Wells were lynching
Early 20th century
File:GoldmanjpgRefusal to stand during the national anthem became a widespread form of United States in World War I
Protests during the anthem continued after World War I For example during the buildup United States home front during World War II
1960s and 1970s

File:Jane Fonda 1975djpgIn the 1960s refusal to stand during the anthem took place for a number of reasons In the late 1960s the protest became increasingly common among athletes and at schools both as an opposition to the Vietnam War and as a protest of nationalism Some of the cases involving students included the following In December 1968 Chris Wood cocaptain of the Adelbert College basketball team was removed from the team for not standing saying "We believe in the fellowship of man We dont believe in nationalism" Five white high school students were suspended in Cumberland Maryland in February 1970 A federal judge Joseph P Kinneary ordered reinstatement of a pair of students in Columbus Ohio saying that forcing anyone to participate in "symbolic patriotic ceremonies" against their will was a violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
From 1968 onwards Jimi Hendrix performed an instrumental version using feedback distortion and other effects to deconstruct the music with the sonic images of rockets and bombs Common interpretations link this to an opposition to the Vietnam War as opposed to Hendrixs own explanation: "Were all Americans&nbsp; it was like Go America! &nbsp;We play it the way the air is in America today The air is slightly static see"

Donald Sutherland Gary Goodrow Peter Boyle and Jane Fonda developed an antiwar comedy show which featured a skit about people refusing to stand during the anthem which toured about 20 cities in 1971

Civil rights activities
At the same time Civil Rights became an important cause which led to anthem protests The 1968 Olympics Black Power salute was a political demonstration conducted by AfricanAmerican athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Summer Olympics in the Estadio Olímpico Universitario
In 1969 University of Wyoming coach Lloyd Eaton dismissed 14 black football players who requested to wear black armbands to protest the racial slurs they faced during games particularly against BYU When the two teams played in 1971 about 50 students at UW refused to stand during the national anthem and wore black armbands during the game Another place where African Americans refused to stand during the anthem in 1971 was at Northern Illinois University basketball games which led to widespread criticism

The protests became widespread and in some cases arrangements were made for the anthem to be played before athletes left the locker room Lew Alcindor later known as Kareem AbdulJabbar began to refuse to stand at UCLA basketball games and in response the anthem was played before the players left the locker room in the UCLAUniversity of Washington game UCLAs coach John Wooden denied that Alcindor or any other UCLA player he coached had refused to stand for the anthem while sometimes the anthem was played while the team was in the locker room or even during warm ups The same was done when the five starters of Florida State Universitys basketball team all African American played Tulane University in 1971 in New Orleans

Civil rights based protests continued into the late 1970s In 1978 a student was barred from receiving his diploma in Dayton Ohio for refusing to sing

Turn of the millennium
On August 24 1990 Irish pop singer Sinéad OConnor threatened to boycott her scheduled performance that night at the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel Township New Jersey if the US national anthem were played In her own words she explained



The Center gave in to her demands but not without controversy Frank Sinatra criticized her the following evening while performing at the same venue stating that he wished that he could "kick her in the ass" New York state Senator Nicholas Spano urged people to boycott OConnors subsequent show in Saratoga Springs New York
In the National Basketball Association
In 2003 two womens basketball players Toni Smith of Manhattanville College and Deidra Chatman of the Virginia Cavaliers womens basketball
In 2004 Carlos Delgado of the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball team decided he would no longer stand during the song "God Bless America" out of protest at Americas wars in the Middle East

On the grounds of spectators experience
Sports spectators felt the anthem performance was integrated poorly to the sports game In 1989 on the New York Times an opinion wrote "Nowadays sports promoters dont even try to get people to participate by singing along and the anthem is either presented like an aria from Tannhäuser (opera)
Many sports spectators afraid of being yelled for not conforming sing along as a "joyless act performed for the sake of keeping out of trouble" which relegated the performance to a "mass display of ritualized obedience" and "performative patriotism" It is also argued that playing the anthem thousands of times a year before every sporting event makes the anthem not as special as it deserves to be Hence saving the anthem for truly deserving circumstances would make the anthem a genuinely patriotic experience
