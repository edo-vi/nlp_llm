Stercomata (or stercomes) are extracellular pellets of waste material produced by some groups of foraminiferans including xenophyophoreans and komokiaceans Gromia and testate amoebae. The pellets are ovoid (egg-shaped) brownish in color and on average measure from 10-20&nbsp;µm in length. Stercomata are composed of small mineral grains and undigested waste products held together by strands of glycosaminoglycans.

The term “sterkome” was first used Schaudinn in 1899 to describe the balls of undigested food remains produced by the testate amoeba Trichosphaerium sieboldi the foraminiferan Saccammina sphaerica and the gromiid Gromia dujardinii. Schaudinn conducted feeding experiments on live individuals of Trichosphaerium sieboldi kept in culture dishes to confirm that stercomata were accumulations of waste material produced as a byproduct of feeding.

Taxonomic distribution

Foraminifera

Stercomata are produced by members of several different subclades of Foraminifera that possess organic-walled or agglutinated tests including: single-chambered taxa with spherical organic-walled tests (e.g. Bathyallogromia and other undescribed species) single-chambered taxa with sac-like agglutinated tests (e.g. Saccammina and Leptammina) single-chambered taxa with tubular agglutinated tests (e.g. Bathysiphon) multi-chambered taxa with organic-walled tests (e.g. Nodellum and Resigella) taxa with complex agglutinated tests composed of delicate branching tubes (Komokioidea) and deep-sea taxa with large complex tests agglutinated tests (Xenophyophorea).

Saccamminid foraminiferans

Komokiaceans

Xenophyophores
In xenophyophores the stercomata are contained within an organic tubes called stercomare.

Multichambered organic-walled foraminiferans

Gromiida
Gromiida is a subclade of Endomyxa a clade that branches within the more inclusive group Rhizaria a clade that encompasses a diverse array free-living and parasitic single-celled eukaryotes that possess branching or anastomosing pseudopodia and complex life cycles. 

In Gromia the only described genus of Gromiida stercomata are spherical to ovoid in shape and range in color from brown to gray to orange.   Individual stercomes range in size from <5 µm (G. psammophila) to 15-30 µm (G. saoirsei). Unlike the stercomata in foraminiferans the stercomata in gromiids are retained in the cytoplasm and not stored outside of the cell body; however after the release of flagellated gametes during sexual reproduction the stercomata remain in the interior of the test.
