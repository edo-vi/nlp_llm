 Home remedies 
Since cat flu treatment is heavily based around relieving symptoms here are some athome remedies for cat owners:

 Being in warm humid air
 If you have a humidifier place it near where your cat tends to sleep
 Bringing your cat in the bathroom as you shower to expose them to the steam
 Gentle face washing
 Since nasal discharge is common a gentle face wipe can help relieve irritation
 Strong smelling foods
 Cats with upper respiratory infections often lose their appetites because they cant smell well Foods such as strong smelling canned food or warmed soft foods can encourage eating
 In more extreme cases an appetite stimulant may be prescribed

 How is it spread? 
Cat flu is spread much like Influenza
To reduce the spread veterinarians recommend vaccination of kittens If a feline is already infected it must be isolated from other cats for at least two weeks All objects touched by the infected cat must be decontaminated including litter boxes and food bowls It is also important to wash your hands before and after interacting with your cat

 Misconceptions and Facts 
In South Africa the term cat flu is also used to refer to canine parvovirus This is misleading as it does not refer to this feline upper respiratory disease but rather refers to the canine parvovirus which mainly infects dogs but can also infect other mammals such as cats skunks and foxes

In the 2013 psychological horror film Escape from Tomorrow there is a fictional strain of cat flu surrounding the Disneyland parks and according to the Disneyland nurse "You could be a host and not even know it" The main protagonist Jim later experiences these symptoms in the end of the film such as constipation vomiting up massive hairballs and blood and gradual weakening of his body Later the next morning his wife discovers his corpse with cat eyes and a grinning face
