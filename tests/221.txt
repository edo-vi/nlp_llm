The history of geology is concerned with the development of the natural science of geology Geology is the scientific study of the origin history and structure of Earth
 
Antiquity

In the year 540 BC Xenophanes described fossil fish and shells found in deposits on mountains Similar fossils were noted by Herodotus (about 490 BC)

Some of the first geological thoughts were about the history of Earth
However it was his successor at the Lyceum the philosopher Theophrastus who made the greatest progress in antiquity in his work On Stones He described many minerals and ores both from local mines such as those at Laurium near Athens and further afield He also quite naturally discussed types of marble and building materials like limestones and attempted a primitive classification of the properties of minerals by their properties such as hardness

Much later in the Ancient Rome

It was not until the 17th century that geology made great strides in its development At this time geology became its own entity in the world of natural science  It was discovered by the Christian world that different translations of the Bible contained different versions of the biblical text  The one entity that remained consistent through all of the interpretations was that the flood myth
During the 17th century both religious and scientific speculation about Earths origin further propelled interest in the Earth and brought about more systematic identification techniques of the Earths stratum
18th century

Also during the eighteenth century aspects of the history of the Earthnamely the divergences between the accepted religious concept and factual evidenceonce again became a popular topic for discussion in society In 1749 the French naturalist GeorgesLouis Leclerc Comte de Buffon published his Histoire Naturelle in which he attacked the popular Biblical accounts given by Whiston and other ecclesiastical theorists of the history of the earth  From experimentation with cooling globes he found that the age of the Earth was not only 4000 or 5500 years as Dating CreationBook of Genesis
With the application of scientific methods to the investigation of the Earths history the study of geology could become a distinct field of science To begin with the terminology and definition of what constituted geological study had to be worked out The term "geology" was first used technically in publications by two Genevan naturalists JeanAndré Deluc and HoraceBénédict de Saussure though "geology" was not well received as a term until it was taken up in the very influential compendium the Encyclopédie published beginning in 1751 by Denis Diderot This was an important step in further promoting knowledge of geology as a science and in recognizing the value of widely disseminating such knowledge

By the 1770s chemistry was starting to play a pivotal role in the theoretical foundation of geology and two opposite theories with committed followers emerged These contrasting theories offered differing explanations of how the rock layers of the Earths surface had formed  One suggested that a liquid inundation perhaps like the biblical deluge had created all geological strata  The theory extended chemical theories that had been developing since the seventeenth century and was promoted by Scotlands  John Walker (natural historian)
19th century

Economic motivations for the practical use of geological data motivated some governments to support geological research  During the 19th century several countries including Canada Australia Great Britain and the United States initiated geological surveying that would produce geological maps of vast areas of the countries Geological mapping provides the location of useful rocks and minerals and such information could be used to benefit the countrys mining and quarrying industries  With the government and industrial funding of geological research more individuals undertook study of geology as technology and techniques improved leading to the expansion of the field of the science

In the 19th century geological inquiry had estimated the age of the Earth in terms of millions of years In 1862 the physicist William Thomson 1st Baron Kelvin  published calculations that fixed the age of the Earth
20th century
By the early 20th Century radiogenic isotopes had been discovered and radiometric dating had been developed In 1911 Arthur Holmes among the pioneers in the use of radioactive decay as a means of measuring geological time dated a sample from Ceylon at 16 billion years old using lead isotopes In 1913 Holmes was on the staff of Imperial College London
File:Wegener Alfred signaturejpgIn 1912 Alfred Wegener proposed the theory of continental drift This theory suggests that the shapes of continents and matching coastline geology between some continents indicates they were joined together in the past and formed a single landmass known as Pangaea; thereafter they separated and drifted like rafts over the ocean floor currently reaching their present position Additionally the theory of continental drift offered a possible explanation as to the formation of mountains; plate tectonics built on the theory of continental drift

Unfortunately Wegener provided no convincing mechanism for this drift and his ideas were not generally accepted during his lifetime Arthur Holmes accepted Wegeners theory and provided a mechanism: mantle convection to cause the continents to move However it was not until after the Second World War that new evidence started to accumulate that supported continental drift There followed a period of 20 years during which the theory of continental drift developed from being believed by a few to being the cornerstone of modern geology Beginning in 1947 research provided new evidence about the ocean floor and in 1960 Bruce C Heezen published the concept of midocean ridges Soon after this Robert S Dietz and Harry Hammond Hess

In recent years geology has continued its tradition as the study of the character and origin of the earth its surface features and internal structure  What changed in the later 20th century is the perspective of geological study  Geology was now studied using a more integrative approach considering the Earth in a broader context encompassing the atmosphere biosphere and hydrosphere<ref>"Studying Earth Sciences" British Geological Survey 2006 Natural Environment
Research Council http://wwwbgsacuk/vacancies/studyinghtm  accessed 29 November 2006</ref>  Satellites located in space that take wide scope photographs of the earth provide such a perspective In 1972 The Landsat Program a series of satellite missions jointly managed by NASA and the US Geological Survey began supplying satellite images that can be geologically analyzed  These images can be used to map major geological units recognize and correlate rock types for vast regions and track the movements of Plate Tectonics A few applications of this data include the ability to produce geologically detailed maps locate sources of natural energy and predict possible natural disasters caused by plate shifts<ref name"bare_url">Rocchio Laura "The Landsat Program" National Aeronautics and Space
