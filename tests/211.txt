DTV is an old series of music videos created by The Walt Disney Company and produced by Charles Braverman and edited by Ted Herrmann which premiered on May 5 1984 by taking hit songs of the past and putting them together with various footage of vintage Disney animation created out of the trend of music videos on cable channel MTV which inspired the name of this series

 Content 
Most songs used were contemporary hits (eg Hall and Oates "Private Eyes") though older songs like Sheb Wooleys 50s hit "The Purple People Eater" were also featured The videos were shown as filler material on Disney Channel (as the network did not air commercials at this time) as well as being the focus of television specials Home video collections were also released on VHS Beta CED Videodisc and Laserdisc formats After the first run of DTV in 1989 a second series was produced known as DTV²

 Theme music 
The main title music known as "RPM" was created in 1981 by a recording company called Network Music When the segments were shown individually on television the title music used was from "Sunset Boulevard" also by Network Music In the opening of DTV a cheeselike Moon zooms out to reveal a black background with blue musical notes A silhouette of Mickey Mouses head rises from the Moon and the Moon exits below the screen The letter D (in the corporate Disney font) and the letters TV appear and zoom out to attach Mickey Mouses head Finally after a few seconds we zoom into Mickey Mouses head and revealing several vintage Disney cartoon clips

 Home media 
Many of the songs listed above were released on VHS in five separate volumes The first three volumes "Pop & Rock" "Rock Rhythm & Blues" and "Golden Oldies" were released in late 1984 as part of Walt Disney Home Videos "Wrapped and Ready to Give" promotion Following that two more videos "Love Songs" and "Groovin For a 60s Afternoon" were released during the summer of 1985
