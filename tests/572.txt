Causes
There are two major theories on the cause of violence in sports One theory holds that humans have an instinct for violence developed during a time when early human ancestors had to resort to violence and aggressiveness to survive and reproduce Another theory deals with the sociological aspects of violence in sports stating that sports are "mock battles" which can become actual battles due to their competitive nature

Violence by athletes
Through a "civilizing process" many modern sports have become less tolerant of bloodshed than past versions although many violent aspects of these sports still remain
 
Athletes sometimes resort to violence in hopes of injuring and intimidating opponents Such incidents may be part of a strategy developed by coaches or players

In boxing unruly or extremely violent behavior by one of the contestants often results in the fighter breaking the rules being penalized with a points reduction or in extreme cases disqualification Outlawed tactics in boxing include hitting the opponent on the back of the head under the belly during clinching and to the back Other tactics that are outlawed but less seen are pushing an opponent extremely hard to the floor kicking or hitting repeatedly after the round has ended Similar actions have also happened in ice hockey and Australian Football League matches
