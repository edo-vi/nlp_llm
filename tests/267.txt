<! Defining the topic and describing the current effort to achieve eradication >
Polio eradication the permanent global cessation of circulation of the poliovirus and hence elimination of the poliomyelitis (polio) it causes is the aim of a multinational public health effort begun in 1988 led by the World Health Organization (WHO) the UNICEF
<! The means by which eradication is attempted (ie vaccination) >
Prevention of disease spread is accomplished by vaccination There are two kinds of polio vaccine—oral polio vaccine (OPV) which uses Attenuated vaccine
<! Progress thus far >
Nigeria is the latest country to have officially stopped endemic transmission of wild poliovirus with its last reported case in 2016

<! Continuing cases >
Recent polio cases arise from two sources the original Wild type
There were 30 confirmed WPV cases in 2022 a decrease from 2019s 5year high of 176 a 
 Factors influencing eradication of polio 
Eradication of polio has been defined in various ways—as elimination of the occurrence of poliomyelitis even in the absence of human intervention as extinction of poliovirus such that the infectious agent no longer exists in nature or in the laboratory as control of an infection to the point at which Transmission (medicine)
In theory if the right tools were available it would be possible to eradicate all infectious diseases that reside only in a human host In reality there are distinct biological features of the organisms and technical factors of dealing with them that make their potential eradicability more or less likely Three indicators however are considered of primary importance in determining the likelihood of successful eradication: that effective interventional tools are available to interrupt transmission of the agent such as a vaccine; that diagnostic tools with sufficient sensitivity and specificity (statistics)
 Strategy 
The most important step in eradication of polio is interruption of :wiktionary:endemic
 High infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the first year of life in developing and endemic countries and routine immunization with OPV or IPV elsewhere
 Organization of "national immunization days" to provide supplementary doses of oral polio vaccine to all children less than five years old
 Active surveillance for poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is a clinical manifestation of poliomyelitis characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone without other obvious cause (eg Physical trauma Expanded environmental surveillance to detect the presence of poliovirus in communities Sewage samples are collected at regular and random sites and tested in laboratories for the presence of WPV or cVDPV Since most polio infections are asymptomatic transmission can occur in spite of the absence of poliorelated AFP cases and such monitoring helps to evaluate the degree to which virus continues to circulate in an area
 Targeted "mopup" campaigns once poliovirus transmission is limited to specific geographical foci

 Vaccination

OPV is delivered as oral drops or infused into sugar cubes It is highly effective and inexpensive (about  per dose in 2016 Because the immune response to oral polio vaccine is very similar to that of natural polio infection it is expected that oral polio vaccination provides similar lifelong immunity (medical)
The primary disadvantage of OPV derives from its inherent nature As an attenuated but active virus it can induce vaccineassociated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in approximately one individual per every 24million doses administered Likewise mutation during the course of persistent circulation in undervaccinated populations can lead to vaccinederived poliovirus strains (cVDPV) that can induce polio at much higher rates than the original vaccine

The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV or Jonas Salk
While IPV does not itself induce mucosal immunity it has been shown to boost the mucosal immunity from OPV and the WHO now favors a combined protocol It is recommended that vulnerable children receive a dose of OPV at birth then beginning at the age of six weeks a primary series consisting of three OPV doses at least four weeks apart along with one dose of IPV after 14 weeks

 Herd immunity 
Polio vaccination is also important in the development of herd immunity For polio to occur in a population there must be an infecting organism (poliovirus) a susceptible human population and a cycle of Transmission (medicine)
When many hosts are vaccinated especially simultaneously the transmission of wild virus is blocked and the virus is unable to find another susceptible individual to infect Because poliovirus can only survive for a short time in the environment (a few weeks at room temperature and a few months at 0–8&nbsp;°C (32–46&nbsp;°F)) without a human host the virus dies out

Herd immunity is an important supplement to vaccination Among those individuals who receive oral polio vaccine only 95 percent will develop immunity after three doses This means that five of every 100 given the vaccine will not develop any immunity and will be susceptible to developing polio According to the concept of herd immunity the population for whom the vaccine fails is still protected by the immunity of those around them Herd immunity may only be achieved when vaccination levels are high

 Vaccinederived poliovirus

While vaccination has played an instrumental role in the reduction of polio cases worldwide the use of attenuated virus in the oral vaccine carries with it an inherent risk The oral vaccine is a powerful tool in fighting polio in part because of its persontoperson transmission and resulting contact immunity However under conditions of longterm circulation in undervaccinated populations the virus can accumulate mutations that reverse the attenuation and result in vaccine virus strains that themselves cause polio As a result of such circulating vaccinederived poliovirus (cVDPV) strains polio outbreaks have periodically recurred in regions that have long been free of the wild virus but where vaccination rates have fallen Oral vaccines can also give rise to persistent infection in immunodeficient individuals with the virus eventually mutating into a more virulent immunodeficiencyassociated vaccinederived poliovirus (iVDPV) In particular the type2 strain seems prone to reversions so in 2016 the eradication effort abandoned the trivalent oral vaccine containing attenuated strains of all three virus types and replaced it with a bivalent oral vaccine lacking the type2 virus while a separate monovalent type2 vaccine (mOPV2) was to be used only to target existing cVDPV2 outbreaks Further a novel oral vaccine targeting type2 (nOPV2) that has been genetically stabilized to make it less prone to give rise to circulating vaccinederived strains is now in limited use

 Surveillance 
A global program of surveillance for the presence of polio and the poliovirus plays a critical role in assessment of eradication and in outbreak detection and response Two distinct methods are used in tandem: acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance and environmental surveillance

Monitoring for AFP aims at identifying outbreaks of polio by screening patients displaying symptoms consistent with but not exclusive to severe poliovirus infection Stool samples are collected from children presenting with AFP and evaluated for the presence of poliovirus by accredited laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network Since rates of nonpolio AFP are expected to be constant and large compared to the number of polio cases the frequency of nonpolio AFP reported in a population is indicative of the effectiveness of surveillance as is the proportion of AFP patients from whom highquality stool samples are collected and tested with a target of at least 80%

Environmental surveillance is used to supplement AFP surveillance This entails the routine testing of sewage samples for the presence of virus which not only allows the effectiveness of vaccination efforts to be evaluated in countries with active transmission but also allows the detection of new outbreaks in countries without known transmission In 2018 the GPEI conducted environmental surveillance in 44 countries 24 of which are in Africa

 Obstacles 

Among the greatest obstacles to global polio eradication are the lack of basic health infrastructure which limits vaccine distribution and delivery the crippling effects of civil war and internal strife and the sometimes oppositional stance that marginalized communities take against what is perceived as a potentially hostile intervention by outsiders Another challenge has been maintaining the Potency (pharmacology)
An independent evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication requested by the WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country In Afghanistan and Pakistan the researchers concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity but that managing human resources political pressures the movement of large populations between and within both countries and inadequately resourced health facilities also posed problems as did technical issues with the vaccine In India the major challenge appeared to be the high efficiency of transmission within the populations of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states set against the low (~80% after three doses against type1) seroconversion response seen from the vaccine In Nigeria the most critical barriers identified were management issues in particular the highly variable importance ascribed to polio by different authorities at the local government level although funding issues community perceptions of vaccine safety inadequate mobilisation of community groups and issues with the cold chain also played a role In those countries where international spread from endemic countries had resulted in the reestablishment of transmission namely Angola Chad and South Sudan the key issues identified were underdeveloped health systems and low routine vaccine coverage although the low level of resources committed to Angola and South Sudan for the purpose of curtailing the spread of polio and climatic factors was also identified as playing a role

Two additional challenges are found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccinederived poliovirus First most individuals infected with poliovirus are asymptomatic or exhibit minor symptoms with fewer than 1% of infections leading to paralysis and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen In 2000 using new screening techniques for the molecular characterization of outbreak viral strains it was discovered that some of the outbreaks were actually caused by circulating vaccinederived poliovirus following mutations or recombinations in the attenuated strain used for the oral polio vaccine This discovery altered the strategy for the discontinuation of vaccination following polio eradication necessitating an eventual switch to the more expensive and logistically more problematic inactivated polio vaccine as continued use of the oral inactivated virus would continue to produce such revertant infectioncausing strains The risk of vaccinederived polio will persist long after the switch to inactivated vaccine as a small number of Asymptomatic carrier
In a 2012 interview with Pakistani newspaper Dawn (newspaper)
Opposition to vaccination efforts

One factor contributing to the continued circulation of polio immunization programs has been opposition to vaccination in some countries (the killers motivated by the belief spread by "radical clerics"  that the vaccine is part of "a Western plot to sterilize Muslims")

In the context of the United States invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent 2003 invasion of Iraq rumours arose in the Muslim world that immunization campaigns were using intentionallycontaminated vaccines to sterilize local Muslim populations or to infect them with HIV In Nigeria these rumours fit in with a longstanding suspicion of modern biomedicine which since its introduction during the era of colonialism has been viewed as a projection of the power of western nations   Refusal of vaccination came to be viewed as resistance to western expansionism and when the contamination rumours led the Nigerian Supreme Council for Sharia to call for a regionwide boycott of polio vaccination polio cases in the country increased more than fivefold between 2002 and 2006 with the uncontrolled virus then spreading across Africa and globally In Afghanistan and Pakistan fears that the vaccine contained contraceptives were one reason given by the Taliban in issuing fatwas against polio vaccination Religious boycotts based on contamination concerns have not been limited to the Muslim world In 2015 after claiming that a tetanus vaccine contained a contraceptive a group of Kenyan Catholic bishops called on their followers to boycott a planned round of polio vaccination This did not have a major effect on vaccination rates and dialog along with vaccine testing forestalled further boycott calls

Other religioninspired refusals arise from concern over whether the virus contains pigderived products and hence are haram (forbidden) in Islam concern that vaccine production may have involved a prohibited taking of animal life Even with the express support of political leaders polio workers or their accompanying security guards have been kidnapped beaten or assassinated

Skepticism in the Muslim world was exacerbated when it was learned that in 2011 the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had conducted a fake hepatitis B immunization campaign hoping to collect blood samples from Osama bin Ladens compound in Abbottabad in order to confirm the genetic identity of the children living there and by implication his own presence leading directly to Killing of Osama bin Laden
Polio vaccination efforts have also faced resistance in another form The priority placed on vaccination by national authorities has turned it into a bargaining chip with communities and interest groups resisting vaccination not due to direct opposition but to leverage other concessions from governmental authorities In Nigeria this has taken the form of block rejection of vaccination that is only resolved when state officials agree to repair or improve schools and healthcare facilities pave roads or install electricity There have been several instances of threatened boycotts by health workers in Pakistan over payment disputes Some governments have been accused of withholding vaccination or the necessary accompanying infrastructure from regions where opposition to their rule is high

 Polio eradication criteria 
A country is regarded as poliofree or nonendemic if no cases have been detected for a year Moreover for WPV1—the only type of the virus which is currently circulating following the eradication of WPV2 and WPV3—only 1 in 200 infection cases exhibit symptoms of polio paralysis in nonvaccinated children and possibly even fewer in vaccinated children
Therefore even a single case is indicative of an epidemic<ref name"LatAmCarib">

According to modeling it can take four to six months of no reported cases to achieve only a 50% chance of eradication and one to two years for eg 95% chance Furthermore virus may shed beyond the expected duration of several weeks in certain individuals Contagiousness can not be readily excluded For a polio virus to be certified as eradicated worldwide at least three years of good surveillance without cases needs to be achieved though this period may need to be longer for a strain like WPV3 where a lower proportion of those infected demonstrate symptoms or if viruspositive environmental samples continue to be reported Wild poliovirus type2 was certified eradicated in 2015 the last case having been detected in 1999

File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183718070001 Kindergarten Schutzimpfung gegen KinderlähmungjpgFollowing the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid1950s the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many industrialized countries In 1962—just one year after Albert Sabin
Much of the work towards eradication was documented by Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado as a List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors
 1988–2000 

In 1988 the World Health Organization (WHO) together with Rotary International UNICEF and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) passed the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) with the goal of eradicating polio by the year 2000 The initiative was inspired by Rotary Internationals 1985 pledge to raise $120million toward immunising all of the worlds children against the disease The last case of Wild type
On 20 August 1994 the Americas were certified as poliofree This achievement was a milestone in efforts to eradicate the disease

In 1994 the Indian Government launched the Pulse Polio Campaign to eliminate polio The current campaign involves annual vaccination of all children under age five

In 1995 Operation MECACAR (Mediterranean Caucasus Central Asian Republics and Russia) was launched; National Immunization Days were coordinated in 19 European and Mediterranean countries In 1998 Melik Minas of Turkey became the last case of polio reported in Europe In 1997 Mum Chanty of Cambodia became the last person to contract polio in the IndoWest Pacific region In 2000 the Western Pacific Region (including China) was certified poliofree

In October 1999 the last isolation of type2 poliovirus occurred in India This type of poliovirus was declared eradicated

Also in October 1999 The CORE Group—with funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)—launched its effort to support national eradication efforts at the grassroots level The CORE Group commenced this initiative in Bangladesh India and Nepal in South Asia and in Angola Ethiopia and Uganda in Africa

 2001–2005 
File:Poliomyelitis world map  DALY  WHO2004svg

















By 2001 575million children (almost onetenth the worlds population) had received some two billion doses of oral polio vaccine The World Health Organization announced that Europe was poliofree on 21 June 2002 in the Copenhagen Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek
In 2002 an outbreak of polio occurred in India The number of planned polio vaccination campaigns had recently been reduced and populations in northern India particularly from the Islamic background engaged in mass resistance to immunization At this time the Indian state Uttar Pradesh accounted for nearly twothirds of total worldwide cases reported (See the :Image:PoliokarteDezember2002jpg
In August 2003 rumors spread in some states in Nigeria especially Kano StateFile:Polio worldwide 2005svg





In May 2004 the first case of the polio outbreak in Sudan was detected The reemergence of polio led to stepped up vaccination campaigns In the city of Darfur 78654 children were immunized and 20432 more in southern Sudan (Yirol and Chelkou)

In 2005 there were 1979 cases of wild poliovirus (excluding vaccinederived poliovirus) Most cases were located in two areas: the Indian subcontinent and Nigeria Eradication efforts in the Indian subcontinent met with a large measure of success Using the Pulse Polio campaign to increase polio immunization rates India recorded just 66 cases in 2005 down from 135 cases reported in 2004 225 in 2003 and 1600 in 2002

Yemen Indonesia and Sudan countries that had been declared poliofree since before 2000 each reported hundreds of cases—probably imported from Nigeria On 5 May 2005 news reports broke that a new case of polio was diagnosed in Java (island)
In the United States on 29 September 2005 the Minnesota Department of Health identified the first occurrence of vaccinederived poliovirus (VDPV) transmission in the United States since OPV was discontinued in 2000 The poliovirus type1 infection occurred in an unvaccinated immunocompromised infant girl aged seven months (the index patient) in an Amish community whose members predominantly were not vaccinated for polio

 2006–2010 

In 2006 only four countries in the world (Nigeria India Pakistan and Afghanistan) were reported to have endemic polio Cases in other countries are attributed to importation A total of 1997 cases worldwide were reported in 2006; of these the majority (1869 cases) occurred in countries with endemic polio (See: :Image:Poliomyelitepng
In 2007 there were 1315 cases of poliomyelitis reported worldwide

In July 2007 a student traveling from Pakistan imported the first polio case to Australia in over 20 years Other countries with significant numbers of wild polio virus cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo which reported 41 cases Chad with 22 cases and Niger and Myanmar each of which reported 11 cases

In 2008 18 countries reported cases and the total number of cases was 1651 Of these 1505 occurred in the four endemic countries and 146 elsewhere The largest numbers were in Nigeria (798 cases) and India (559 cases): these two countries combined had 822 percent of all cases Outside endemic countries Chad reported the greatest number (37 cases)

In 2009 a total of 1604 cases were reported across 23 countries Four endemic countries accounted for 1256 of these with the remaining 348 in 19 subSaharan countries with imported cases or reestablished transmission Once again the largest numbers were in India (741) and Nigeria (388) All other countries had less than one hundred cases: Pakistan had 89 cases Afghanistan 38 Chad 64 Sudan 45 Guinea 42 Angola 29 Côte dIvoire 26 Benin 20 Kenya 19 Burkina Faso 15 Niger 15 the Central African Republic 14 Mauritania 13 and Liberia and Sierra Leone both had 11 The following countries had singledigit numbers of cases: Uganda with 8 cases Togo 6 Cameroon 3 the Democratic Republic of the Congo 3 Burundi 2 and Mali 2

According to figures updated in April 2012 the WHO reported that there were 1352 cases of wild polio across 20 countries in 2010 Reported cases of polio were down 95% in Nigeria (to a historic low of 21 cases) and 94% in India (to a historic low of 42 cases) compared to the previous year with little change in Afghanistan (from 38 to 25 cases) and an increase in cases in Pakistan (from 89 to 144 cases) An acute outbreak in Tajikistan gave rise to 460 cases (34% of the global total) and was associated with a further 18 cases across Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan) and the Russian Federation with the most recent case from this region being reported from Russia 25 September These were the first cases in the WHO European region since 2002 The Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) saw an outbreak with 441 cases (30% of the global total) At least 179 deaths were associated with this outbreak which is believed to have been an importation from the ongoing type1 outbreak in Angola (33 cases in 2010) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (100 cases)



 2011–2015 
File:Polio worldwide 2011svgFile:Polio Vaccination in TehranjpgIn 2011 650 WPV cases were reported across sixteen countries: the four endemic countries—Pakistan Afghanistan Nigeria and India—as well as twelve others Polio transmission recurred in Angola Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Kenya reported its first case since 2009 while China reported 21 cases mostly among the Uyghurs of Hotan prefecture Xinjiang the first cases since 1994

The total number of wildvirus cases reported in 2012 was 223 lower than any previous year These were limited to five countries—Nigeria Pakistan Afghanistan Chad and Niger—of which all except Nigeria had fewer cases than in 2011 A total of 416 wildvirus cases were reported in 2013 almost double the previous year Of these cases in endemic countries dropped from 197 to 160 while those in nonendemic countries jumped from 5 to 256 owing to two outbreaks: one in the Horn of Africa and one in Syria

In April 2013 a case of wild polio in Mogadishu was reported the first in Somalia since 2007 By October over 170 cases had been reported in the country with more cases in neighboring Kenya and the Somali Region of Ethiopia

Routine sewage monitoring in 2012 had detected a WPV1 strain of Pakistani origin in Cairo sparking a major vaccination push there The strain spread to Israel where there was widespread environmental detection but like Egypt no paralysis cases It had more severe consequences when it spread to neighboring Syria with the total number of cases eventually reaching 35 the first outbreak there since 1999

In April 2013 the WHO announced a new $55billion 6year cooperative plan (called the 2013–18 Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan) to eradicate polio from its last reservoirs The plan called for mass immunization campaigns in the three remaining endemic countries and also dictated a switch to inactivated virus injections to avoid the risk of the vaccinederived outbreaks that occasionally occur from use of the livevirus oral vaccine

In 2014 there were 359 reported cases of wild poliomyelitis spread over twelve countries Pakistan had the most with 306 an increase from 93 in 2013 which was blamed on Al Qaeda and Taliban militants preventing aid workers from vaccinating children in rural regions of the country On 27 March 2014 the WHO announced the eradication of poliomyelitis in the SouthEast Asia Region in which the WHO includes eleven countries: Bangladesh Bhutan North Korea India Indonesia Maldives Myanmar Nepal Sri Lanka Thailand and TimorLeste With the addition of this region the proportion of world population living in poliofree regions reached 80%File:Polio worldwide 2015svg
During 2015 74 cases of wild poliomyelitis were reported worldwide 54 in Pakistan and 20 in Afghanistan There were 32 circulating vaccinederived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases in 2015

On 25 September 2015 the WHO declared that Nigeria was no longer considered endemic for wild polio virus A WPV1 strain not seen in five years resurfaced in Nigeria the following year

The WPV2 virus was declared eradicated in September 2015 as it had not been detected in circulation since 1999

 2016–2020 
File:Polio worldwide 2016svgBecause cVDPV2 strains continued to arise from trivalent oral vaccine that included attenuated PV2 during 2016 this vaccine was replaced with a bivalent version lacking WPV2 as well as trivalent injected inactivated vaccine that cannot lead to cVDPV cases This was expected to prevent new strains of cVDPV2 from arising and allow eventual cessation of WPV2 vaccination The resulting global use of the injectable vaccine caused shortages and led the WHO in April 2017 to recommend general use of the fIPV vaccination protocol involving subcutaneous injection of a lower dose than used in the standard Intramuscular injection
In 2016 there were 37 reported WPV1 cases half as many as in 2015 with the majority of the cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan A small number of additional cases in Nigeria caused by WPV1 were viewed as a setback the first being detected there in almost two years yet the virus had been circulating undetected in regions inaccessible due to the activities of Boko Haram There was also a cVDPV1 outbreak in Laos while new strains of cVDPV2 arose separately in Nigerias Borno and Sekoto states and in the Quetta area of Pakistan collectively causing five cases

In 2017 there were 22 reported WPV1 polio cases with onset of paralysis in 2017 down from 37 in 2016 Eight of the cases were in Pakistan and 14 in Afghanistan In Pakistan transmission of several genetic lineages of WPV1 seen in 2015 had been interrupted by September 2017 though at least two genetic clusters remain In spite of a significant drop in detected cases in Pakistan there was an increase in the percentage of environmental samples that test positive for the polio virus suggesting gaps in identification of infected individuals In the third country where polio remained endemic Nigeria there were no cases though as few as 7% of infants were fully vaccinated in some districts An April 2017 spill at a vaccine production facility in the Netherlands only resulted in one asymptomatic WPV2 infection despite release into the sewer system

Laos was declared free of cVDPV1 in March 2017 but three distinct cVDPV2 outbreaks occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo one of them of recent origin the other two having circulated undetected for more than a year Together they caused 20 cases by years end In Syria a large outbreak began at Mayadin Deir ezZor Governorate a center of fighting in the Syrian Civil War and also spreading to neighboring districts saw 74 confirmed cases from a viral strain that had circulated undetected for about two years Circulation of multiple genetic lines of cVDPV2 was also detected in Banadir province Somalia but no infected individuals were identified

  WHOs Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization recommended that cVDPV2 suppression be prioritized over targeting WPV1 and according to protocol OPV2 is restricted to this purpose



There were 33 reported WPV1 paralysis cases with an onset of paralysis in 2018 – 21 in Afghanistan and 12 in Pakistan Polio in Pakistan resurged in the latter part of the year due in part to the rates of parental refusal for vaccination increasing with wild poliovirus detected in 20% of the years environmental samples  In Afghanistan different strains were largely responsible for the cases in the northeast and south of the country In Nigeria the third country classified as having endemic transmission security concerns continued to limit access to some areas of the country though migration and novel vaccination approaches would reduce the number of unreached children The nation passed two full years without a detected wildvirus case though elimination of WPV transmission could not be confirmedFile:Polio vaccine in the DRC (8330379372)jpg

In 2019 there were 176 WPV1 paralysis cases detected: 29 in Afghanistan and 147 in Pakistan and crossborder migration played a role in polio transmission between the two countries While itself problematic this also fostered a dangerous false narrative in both nations blaming the other for the presence and spread of polio in their own country Environmental sampling in Pakistan showed the virus presence in eight urban areas a setback officials attributed primarily to vaccine refusal Opponents to vaccination in Pakistan launched a series of attacks in April that left a vaccinator and two security men dead while false rumors and hoax videos reporting vaccine toxicity also disrupted vaccination efforts there Wild poliovirus of Pakistani origin also spread to Iran where it was detected in several environmental samples

In the third remaining country in which polio was classified as endemic Nigeria wild poliovirus has not been detected since October 2016 and levels of AFP surveillance are sufficient even in securitycompromised regions to suggest transmission of WPV may have been interrupted Global WPV3 eradication was certified in October 2019 the virus not having been seen since 2012

In addition to the WPV resurgence in Pakistan and Afghanistan 2019 saw a resurgence of cVDPV with 378 cases In addition to eighteen reported paralysis cases in Nigeria the cVDPV2 outbreaks there spread to Benin Burkina Faso Chad Ghana Niger and Togo while the virus was also detected in environmental samples from Cameroon and Ivory Coast Somalias continuing outbreaks caused a halfdozen cases there and in neighboring Ethiopia with a separate Ethiopia outbreak adding one case The Democratic Republic of the Congo had numerous new and continuing outbreaks producing more than 80 cases while multiple new cVDPV2 outbreaks in Angola and the Central African Republic resulted in more than a hundred cases Individual new outbreaks of cVDPV2 also caused more than a dozen paralysis cases each in Pakistan while smaller outbreaks struck Chad China and Zambia A separate cVDPV1 outbreak in the Philippines also caused cases in Malaysia where cVDPV2 of Filipino origin was also detected in environmental samples while additional cVDPV1 outbreaks caused six cases in Myanmar and one case in Yemen


File:Polio worldwide 2020svg140 cases of WPV1 paralysis were reported in 2020 all in Afghanistan or Pakistan

In March 2020 the GPEI announced polio eradication resources were being redeployed against the COVID19 pandemic recognizing that this would adversely affect its efforts at eradicating polio All vaccination efforts both routine and targeted were postponed for several months with staff reassigned to COVID19 control Subsequent statistical analysis indicated that the COVID pandemic resulted in  decreases of more than 30% globally in both AFP and environmental surveillance with only 23 of 43 priority countries meeting their surveillance targets for 2020 Additional challenges were a conspiracy theory circulating on social media claiming that the polio vaccine contained coronavirus and moves by President Donald Trump of the United States to cut funding for the World Health Organization

Nigeria was removed from the list of countries with endemic wild poliovirus in June 2020 four years after the last recorded case in the Northern State of Borno in 2016 Two months later the World Health Organization declared the African continent free of wild poliovirus This certification came after extensive assessments of the certifications of National Polio Certification Commissions (NCCs) and confirmation that at least 95% of Africas population had been immunised as there remain major continuing outbreaks of vaccinederived poliovirus in West Africa and Ethiopia in addition to wild cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan

Over 1000 cases caused by both continuing and novel outbreaks of cVDPV2 were reported in 2020 across twentyfour countries with 31 additional cases of cVDPV1 and environmental detections in several additional countries with no diagnosed polio cases While in the past cVDPV outbreaks tended to remain localized significant international spread of these strains was observed

In 2021 there were just six confirmed cases of wild poliovirus — one in Pakistan four in Afghanistan and one in Malawi

2021 saw a partial recovery from the challenges to monitoring brought on by the COVID pandemic with 74% of highpriority countries meeting surveillance targets an improvement of over 20% from the previous year March 2021 also saw the first use of the modified nOPV2 vaccine in selected countries engineered to allow vaccination against strain2 poliovirus without the frequent spawning of cVDPV2 seen with the original OPV2 Full rollout was not expected until 2023

Despite previous resistance to eradication efforts after their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 the Taliban agreed to allow United Nations healthcare workers to carry out doortodoor vaccination nationwide for the first time in three years including a commitment to allowing women to participate in the effort and to provide safety guarantees to eradication staff Pakistans lone case dated from January but the virus continued to be detected in environmental samples through December The case in Malawi the countrys first in almost three decades and the first in Africa in five years was seen as a significant setback to the eradication effort Based on similarity to a strain last detected in Pakistan in 2019 it is thought that WPV1 has been circulating undetected in the country for some time

In 2021 reported cVDPV2 cases declined to 700 across 22 countries over half occurring in Nigeria The virus was also found in environmental samples or in those from symptomfree people in several additional African and Asian nations without reported cases 13 cases of cVDPV1 were identified in Madagascar and 3 in Yemen No cases of cVDPV3 were observed though it was detected in environmental samples from China Israel and its adjacent occupied territories

In 2022 there were 30 confirmed cases of WPV1 reported to WHO with two and twenty cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan respectively while eight nonendemic cases were recorded in Mozambique The cases in Pakistan were the first seen in the country in 15 months though the virus had been detected in environmental samples during the intervening period

The residual effects of the COVID19 pandemic continued to be a cause for concern due to an increased risk of undetected outbreaks due to COVIDs interference with routine health care disease detection and childhood vaccinations as well as a concern that an increased fear of vaccines caused at least in part by politicization of vaccination and bad governance during the pandemic may result in a general pattern of undervaccination including for polio In Pakistan a contributing factor to the resurgence of wild virus cases in the country has been threats of violence both from those with antivaccine sentiment and from religious extremists A vaccination worker was assassinated in March 2022 and a vaccinator and two accompanying police officers providing security for a doortodoor vaccination campaign were murdered in June
However the situation had improved compared to previous years as the government and lawenforcement increased their focus By October 2022 endemic transmission was restricted to seven districts in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the number of circulating genetic clusters was down to one from eleven in 2020
The situation improved in Afghanistan as well as between 2021 and 2022 the country became significantly more peaceful as the government consolidated their control though with remaining pockets of violence

Vaccinederived cases continue to circulate particularly in the African and Eastern Mediterranean WHO regions Concern is focused on Ukraine where cVDPV had been detected in fall 2021 vaccination efforts were halted due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine

As of October 31 ten cases of WPV1 have been reported in 2023 six in Afghanistan and four in Pakistan Additionally almost 100 positive environmental samples were reported so far in those countries
There have been 237 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 reported to the WHO so far in 2023 across seventeen countries 
cVDPV1 is now concentrated in two countries 79 cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 23 in Madagascar Mozambique had three cases this year up until February 
No cVDPV3 virus has been detected for over one and a half years now 

The Independent Monitoring Board of the GPEI in its September 2023 Report  mentioned a continued geographically restricted endemic transmission in the east of Afghanistan and in the southern districts of Pakistans Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province 
All but one wild polio generic cluster remains in Afghanistan in a much improved immunity (>90%) of the population Levels of access in the country are the best they have been since 2018 
However a large pool of unvaccinated children remain in the Kandahar province potentially leading to a large outbreak if the virus reappears there 
In Pakistan they esteem that the longstanding and intractable poliovirus circulation in most of the traditional endemic
reservoirs has been eliminated
However a positive environmental probe in Karachi after no cases for over a year raised concerns about the vaccination campaign quality in Pakistan
In conclusion the report finds it is highly likely that the goal of interrupting wild poliovirus transmission this year will be missed It is certain that ending transmission of vaccinederived poliovirus will not be possible this year

PostEradication Plans
As of 2023 WPV2 and WPV3 are certified as eradicated while certification of WPV1 is expected for 2026/7

Certification of wild poliovirus eradication requires three consecutive years without case reports in the presence of reliable disease surveillance networks Beginning at certification of WPV eradication the postcertification strategy will come into effect with program priorities shifting towards outbreak preparedness and containment of existing virus material rather than circulating disease Vaccination for WPV1 will cease one year following eradication certification and eradication of vaccinederived poliovirus is then targeted for 2030

Where possible the number of facilities conducting operations with poliovirus is to be reduced significantly; and the use of wild poliovirus is to be abandoned altogether in favour of geneticallystabilized attenuated strains where possible As of May 2021 there are 74 designated Poliovirus Essential Facilities (PEFs) across 24 countries Work on Poliovirus outside of the PEFs will be prohibited and stocks in laboratories that are not designated as PEFs must either be transferred to a PEF or destroyed

By 2022 all stocks of WPV2 had been transferred to PEFs and full containment is in effect All other strains are in a transitionary status
