The studies conducted by the FinnProstate group include the following:

 FinnProstate1 (FinnProstateI; Finnish Multicentre Study of Prostatic Cancer) – ethinylestradiol 150&nbsp;μg/day (1&nbsp;mg/day initially) plus polyestradiol phosphate 80&nbsp;mg/month (160&nbsp;mg/month initially) versus orchiectomy for advanced prostate cancer
 FinnProstate2 (FinnProstateII) – polyestradiol phosphate 160&nbsp;mg/month (with or without lowdose aspirin) versus orchiectomy for advanced prostate cancer
 FinnProstate3 (FinnProstateIII) – cancelled
 FinnProstate4 (FinnProstateIV) – polyestradiol phosphate 160&nbsp;mg/month versus buserelin (with cyproterone acetate 300&nbsp;mg/day initially to prevent gonadotropin flare) in advanced prostate cancer FinnProstate5 (FinnProstateV) – cancelled
 FinnProstate6 (FinnProstateVI) – polyestradiol phosphate 240&nbsp;month (320&nbsp;mg/month initially) versus orchiectomy for advanced prostate cancer
 FinnProstate7 (FinnProstateVII) – intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer
