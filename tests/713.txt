Needing a par on the 18th hole for a oneshot victory Mickelson continued with his aggressive style of play and chose to hit a driver off the tee; he hit his shot well left of the fairway (he had hit only two of thirteen fairways previously in the round) The ball bounced off a corporate hospitality tent and settled in an area of trampleddown grass that was enclosed with trees He decided to go for the green with his second shot rather than play it safe and pitch out into the fairway His ball then hit a tree and did not advance more than  His next shot plugged into the left greenside bunker He was unable to get up and down from there resulting in a double bogey and costing him a chance of winning the championship outright or getting into an 18hole playoff with Ogilvy

After his disappointing finish Mickelson said: "Im still in shock I still cant believe I did that This one hurts more than any tournament because I had it won Congratulations to Geoff Ogilvy on some great play I want to thank all the people that supported me The only thing I can say is Im sorry" He was even more candid when he said: "I just cant believe I did that Im such an idiot"
