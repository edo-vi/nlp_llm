The Deep Crustal Hot Zone (DCHZ) or just deep hot zone is a Mohorovičić discontinuity
The upper crust consists mainly of evolved intermediate to silicic magmatic rocks These rocks may form from either igneous differentiation
 Dynamics 
The hot mantle material is intruded in the form of a mafic sill (geology)
To migrate upwards enough melt needs to accumulate so it becomes mobile Whenever there is not enough melt the rock is more a crystalline mush where melt is formed around grain boundaries Once the melt fraction the part of the rock which consists of liquid reaches a certain value the melt will be mobile enough to migrate upwards This value is called the SolidtoLiquid Transition (SLT) and has a value between 04 and 06

Melt forms an interconnected network along grain boundaries at melt fractions larger than 001 This means that at this point melt can start to slowly move upwards It collects in layers on the top of the mantle intrusions or just above it It forms layers here since the overlying portion of the crust is much cooler than the hot zone where hot mantle material is continuously intruded Thus the melt cools down on the top of the layer until it approaches its solidus (chemistry)
Melt keeps gathering in these layers until the solidtoliquid transition is reached and the melt migrates upwards again The melt uses local features like dikes and faults to migrate towards the surface

From Numerical modeling (geology)
 Chemistry 
The melt that is formed will consist partly of crustal material and partly of mantle material It will have the chemical signatures of both crustal and mantle material Because the melt consists of reworked mantle material and remolten crustal material it will be more evolved than the mantle material that intruded The material that will migrate upwards is expected to be mostly rhyolitic
