 Safety and efficacy 
A 2015 study on Melafix found it had no antibacterial properties against several common fish pathogens and suggested that reports of success with the product from hobbyists might point to immunostimulant properties instead It also concluded that the product had no harmful impact on either goldfish or common clownfish

Another study the same year tested its efficacy against the common guppy parasite Gyrodactylus turnbulli An in vitro experiment found that Melafix as well as the cajeput oil and an emulsifier used in the product tested separately were as effective against the parasite as the antihelminthic drug Levamisole An in vivo experiment found Melafix highly effective against the parasite when used in combination with another product from the company Pimafix However neither product was significantly different than the control on its own
