A conjugate vaccine is a type of subunit vaccine which combines a weak antigen with a strong antigen as a carrier so that the immune system has a stronger response to the weak antigen

Vaccines are used to prevent diseases by invoking an immune response to an antigen part of a bacterium or virus that the immune system recognizes This is usually accomplished with an attenuated or dead version of a pathogenic bacterium or virus in the vaccine so that the immune system can recognize the antigen later in life

Most vaccines contain a single antigen that the body will recognize However the antigen of some pathogens does not elicit a strong response from the immune system so a vaccination against this weak antigen would not protect the person later in life In this case a conjugate vaccine is used in order to invoke an immune system response against the weak antigen In a conjugate vaccine the weak antigen is covalently attached to a strong antigen thereby eliciting a stronger immunological response to the weak antigen Most commonly the weak antigen is a polysaccharide that is attached to strong protein antigen However peptide/protein and protein/protein conjugates have also been developed

 History 
The idea of a conjugate vaccine first appeared in experiments involving rabbits in 1927 when the immune response to the Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 polysaccharide antigen was increased by combining the polysaccharide antigen with a protein carrier The first conjugate vaccine used in humans became available in 1987 Soon after the vaccine was made available the rates of Hib infection dropped with a decrease of 907% between 1987 and 1991 Infection rates diminished even more once the vaccine was made available for infants

 Technique 
Vaccines evoke an immune response to an antigen and the immune system reacts by producing T cells and antibodies By conjugating the polysaccharide to a protein carrier a T cell response can be induced Normally polysaccharides by themselves cannot be loaded onto the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of Antigenpresenting cell
 Approved conjugate vaccines

In 2018 World Health Organization recommended the use of the Typhoid vaccine
In 2021 Soberana 02 a conjugate COVID19 vaccine developed in Cuba was given emergency use authorisation in Cuba and Iran
