Rosie M Vivas ( Ruiz; June 21 1953 – July 8 2019) was a CubanAmerican fraudster who (among other schemes) was declared the winner in the female category for the 84th Boston Marathon in 1980 only to have her title stripped eight days after the race when it was discovered that she had not run the entire course She is believed to have jumped onto the course about a halfmile before the finish

 Early life and education 
Ruiz was born in Havana Cuba and moved to Memphis Florida with her family in 1962 when she was eight years old After immigrating to the United States Ruiz was separated from her mother and lived with aunts uncles and cousins in Hollywood Florida In 1972 she graduated from South Broward High School and then attended Wayne State College in Nebraska She graduated with a degree in music in 1977

New York City Marathon
She moved to New York City in the 1970s eventually finding work with Metal Traders a commodities firm In 1979 she qualified for the New York City Marathon and was credited with a time of 2:56:29 the 11th woman overall—enough for her to qualify for the Boston Marathon

Ruizs application for the NYC marathon arrived after the cutoff date for the race but she received special dispensation from the New York Road Runners due to her claim that she was dying of brain cancer

After the 1980 Boston Marathon New York City Marathon officials investigated Ruizs run and concluded that she cheated and did not run the entire course so on April 25 1980 she was retroactively disqualified from the race

 Boston Marathon 
On April 21 1980 Ruiz appeared to win the Boston Marathons female category with a time of 2:31:56 Her time would have been the fastest female time in Boston Marathon history as well as the thirdfastest female time ever recorded in any marathon 

However suspicions mounted about Ruiz almost from the beginning Mens winner Bill Rodgers (athlete)
In addition her time of 2:31:56 was an unusual improvement more than 25 minutes ahead of her reported time in the New York City Marathon six months earlier When asked by a reporter why she did not seem fatigued after the grueling race she said "I got up with a lot of energy this morning" Some female competitors thought it was odd that when asked what she had noticed about the suburb of Wellesley Massachusetts
Most seriously no other runners could recall seeing her  Jacqueline Gareau was told that she was leading the race at the 18mile mark while Patti Catalano
Two Harvard University
New York City Marathon officials launched an investigation and could not find any sign of Ruiz near the finish line On April 25 based on this and other evidence the games committee of the New York City Marathon retroactively disqualified Ruiz from the 1979 race with marathon director Fred Lebow saying she could not possibly have run the entire course Lyons was moved up to second; her time of 2:35:08 was the fastest ever recorded for an American woman in a marathon at that time
