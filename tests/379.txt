A legal singularity is a hypothetical future point in time beyond which the law is much more completely specified with human lawmakers and other legal actors being supported by rapid technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI) leading to a vast reduction in legal uncertainty

The legal singularity is based on the idea that as AI systems become more advanced they will be capable of processing and analyzing vast amounts of legal data and case law more quickly and accurately than humans

There is much debate around whether the legal singularity is possible or desirable among legal scholars ethicists and AI researchers While some see it as a potential way to improve legal efficiency and reduce bias
