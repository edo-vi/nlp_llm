Societal collapse (also known as civilizational collapse or systems collapse) is the fall of a complex human society characterized by the loss of cultural identity and of social complexity as an Complex adaptive system
Virtually all civilizations have suffered such a fate regardless of their size or complexity but some of them later revived and transformed such as China India and Egypt However others never recovered such as the Western and Eastern Roman Empires the Spanish conquest of the Maya
Anthropologists (quantitative) historians and sociologists have proposed a variety of explanations for the collapse of civilizations involving causative factors such as environmental change depletion of resources unsustainable complexity invasion disease decay of social cohesion rising social inequality
The study of societal collapse collapsology is a topic for specialists of history anthropology sociology and political science More recently they are joined by experts in cliodynamics and study of complex systems

 Concept 
Joseph Tainter frames societal collapse in  The Collapse of Complex Societies (1988) a seminal and founding work of the academic discipline on societal collapse He elaborates that collapse is a "broad term" but in the sense of societal collapse he views it as "a political process"<ref name"Tainter"> "What is collapse? 
Collapse is a broad term that can cover many kinds of processes It means different 
things to different people Some see collapse as a thing that could happen only to societies organized at the most complex level To them the notion of tribal societies or village horticulturalists collapsing will seem odd Others view collapse in terms of 
economic disintegration of which the predicted end of industrial society is the 
ultimate expression Still others question the very utility of the concept pointing out that art styles and literary traditions often survive political decentralization 
Collapse as viewed in the present work is a political process It may and often 
does have consequences in such areas as economics art and literature but it is 
fundamentally a matter of the sociopolitical sphere A society has collapsed when it 
displays a rapid significant loss of an established level of sociopolitical complexity The 
term established level is important To qualify as an instance of collapse a society 
must have been at or developing toward a level of complexity for more than one or 
two generations The demise of the Carolingian Empire thus is not a case of collapse 
 merely an unsuccessful attempt at empire building The collapse in turn must be 
rapid  taking no more than a few decades  and must entail a substantial loss of 
sociopolitical structure Losses that are less severe or take longer to occur are to be 
considered cases of weakness and decline  The fall of the Roman Empire is in the West the most widely known instance of 
collapse the one which comes most readily to popular thought" (Pages 45)</ref> He further narrows societal collapse as a rapid process (within "few decades") of "substantial loss of sociopolitical structure" giving the fall of the Western Roman Empire as "the most widely known instance of collapse" in the Western world

 Societal longevity 

The social scientist Luke Kemp analyzed dozens of civilizations which he defined as "a society with agriculture multiple cities military dominance in its geographical region and a continuous political structure" from 3000 BC to 600 AD and calculated that the average life span of a civilization is close to 340 years

A statistical analysis of empires by complex systems specialist Samuel Arbesman suggests that collapse is generally a random event and does not depend on age That is analogous to what evolutionary biologists call the Red Queen hypothesis which asserts that for a species in a harsh ecology extinction is a persistent possibility

Contemporary discussions about societal collapse are seeking resilience by suggesting societal transformation

 Causes of collapse 
Because human societies are complex systems common factors may contribute to their decline that are economical environmental demographic social and cultural and they may domino effect

 Natural disasters and climate change 
File:Indus Valley Civilization Mature Phase (26001900 BCE)png
Archeologists identified signs of a megadrought for a millennium between 5000 and 4000 years ago in Africa and Asia The drying of the Green Sahara not only turned it into a desert but also disrupted the monsoon seasons in South and Southeast Asia and caused flooding in East Asia which prevented successful harvest and the development of complex culture It coincided with and may have caused the decline and the fall of the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley Civilization The dramatic shift in climate is known as the 42kiloyear event

The highly advanced Indus Valley civilisation
Volcanic eruptions can abruptly influence the climate During a large eruption sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is expelled into the stratosphere where it could stay for years and gradually get oxidized into sulfate aerosols Being highly reflective sulfate aerosols reduce the incident sunlight and cool the Earths surface By drilling into glaciers and ice sheets scientists can access the archives of the history of atmospheric composition A team of multidisciplinary researchers led by Joseph McConnell of the Desert Research Institute in Reno Nevada deduced that a volcanic eruption occurred in 43 BC a year after the assassination of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March (15 March) in 44 BC which left a power vacuum and led to bloody civil wars According to historical accounts it was also a period of poor weather crop failure widespread famine and disease Analyses of tree rings and cave stalagmites from different parts of the globe provided complementary data The Northern Hemisphere got drier but the Southern Hemisphere became wetter Indeed the Greek historian Appian recorded that there was a lack of flooding in Egypt which also faced famine and pestilence Romes interest in Egypt as a source of food intensified and the aforementioned problems and civil unrest weakened Egypts ability to resist Egypt came under Roman rule after Cleopatra committed suicide in 30 BC While it is difficult to say for certain whether Egypt would have become a Roman province if Mount OkmokFile:2000+_year_global_temperature_including_Medieval_Warm_Period_and_Little_Ice_Age__Ed_HawkinssvgMore generally recent research pointed to climate change as a key player in the decline and fall of historical societies in China the Middle East Europe and the Americas In fact paleoclimatology
The Mongol conquests corresponded to a period of cooling in the Northern Hemisphere between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries when the Medieval Warm Period was giving way to the Little Ice Age which caused ecological stress In Europe the cooling climate did not directly facilitate the Black Death but it caused wars mass migration and famine which helped diseases spread

Foreign invasions and mass migration
File:Invasions destructions and possible population movements during the Bronze Age Collapse ca 1200 BCpng
Between ca 4000 and 3000 BCE Neolithic decline
A mysterious loose confederation of fierce maritime marauders known as the Sea Peoples was identified as one of the main causes of the Late Bronze Age collapse in the Eastern Mediterranean The Sea Peoples might have themselves been victims of the environmental changes that led to widespread famine and precipitated the Collapse After the Battle of Kadesh against the Egyptians in 1285 BC the Hittite Empire began to show signs of decline Attacks by the Sea Peoples accelerated the process and internal power struggles crop failures and famine were contributory factors The Egyptians with whom the Hittites signed a peace treaty supplied them with food in times of famine but it was not enough Around 1200 BC the Sea Peoples seized a port on the west coast of Asia Minor cutting off the Hittites from their trade routes from which their supply of grain came Hattusa the Hittite capital was destroyed Some Hittite territories survived but would eventually be occupied by the Assyrians in the seventh century BC

The Minoan civilization based on Crete centered on religious rituals and seaborne trade In around 1450 BC it was absorbed into Mycenaean Greece which itself went into serious decline around 1200 BC because of various military conflicts including the Dorian invasion from the north and attacks from the Sea PeoplesFile:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1png
In the eleventh century AD North Africas populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after it had exhausted its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the Bedouin tribes of Banu Sulaym and Banu Hilal Ibn Khaldun noted that all of the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become arid desert
File:Expansion of the Mongol EmpiresvgIn 1206 a warlord achieved dominance over all Mongols with the title Genghis Khan and began his campaign of territorial expansion The Mongols highly flexible and mobile cavalry enabled them to conquer their enemies with efficiency and swiftness In the brutal pillaging that followed Mongol invasions during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the invaders decimated the populations of China Russia the Middle East and Islam in Central Asia

 Famine economic depression and internal strife 

Around 1210 BC the New Kingdom of Egypt shipped large amounts of grains to the disintegrating Hittite Empire Thus there had been a food shortage in Anatolia but not the Nile Valley However that soon changed Although Egypt managed to deliver a decisive and final defeat to the Sea Peoples at the Battle of the Delta
Between 481 BC and 221 BC the Warring States period
In the early fourteenth century AD Britain suffered repeated rounds of crop failures from unusually heavy rainfall and flooding Much livestock either starved or drowned Food prices skyrocketed and King Edward II attempted to rectify the situation by imposing price controls but vendors simply refused to sell at such low prices In any case the act was abolished by the Lincoln Parliament in 1316 Soon people from commoners to nobles were finding themselves short of food Many resorted to begging crime and eating animals they otherwise would not eat People in northern England had to deal with raids from Scotland There were even reports of cannibalism

In Continental Europe things were at least just as bad The Great Famine of 1315–1317 coincided with the end of the Medieval Warm Period and the start of the Little Ice Age Some historians suspect that the change in climate was due to Mount Tarawera in New Zealand erupting in 1314 The Great Famine was however only one of the calamities striking Europe that century as the Hundred Years War and Black Death would soon follow (Also see the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages) Recent analysis of tree rings complement historical records and show that the summers of 1314–1316 were some of the wettest on record over a period of 700 years

Disease outbreaks

File:The angel of death striking a door during the plague of Rome Wellcome L0004061jpgHistorically the dawn of agriculture led to the rise of contagious diseases Compared to their huntinggathering counterparts agrarian societies tended to be sedentary have higher population densities be in frequent contact with livestock and be more exposed to contaminated water supplies and higher concentrations of garbage Poor sanitation a lack of medical knowledge superstitions and sometimes a combination of disasters exacerbated the problem

From the description of symptoms by the Greek physician Galen which included coughing fever (blackish) diarrhea swollen throat and thirst modern experts identified the probable culprits of the Antonine Plague (165–180 AD) to have been smallpox or measles

In the sixth century AD while the Western Roman Empire had already succumbed to attacks by the Germanic tribes the Eastern Roman Empire stood its ground In fact a peace treaty with the Persians allowed Emperor Justinian I
The epidemic also devastated the Sasanian Empire in Persia Caliph Abu Bakr seized the opportunity to launch military campaigns that Muslim conquest of PersiaFile:Bubonic plagueensvg
There is evidence that the Mongol expeditions may have spread the bubonic plague across much of Eurasia which helped to spark the Black Death of the early fourteenth century The Italian historian Gabriel de Mussis
With labor in short supply workers bargaining power increased dramatically Various inventions that reduced the cost of labor saved time and raised productivity such as the threefield crop rotation system the iron plow the use of manure to fertilize the soil and the water pumps were widely adopted Many former serfs now free from feudal obligations relocated to the cities and changed profession to crafts and trades The more successful ones became the new middle class Trade flourished as demands for a myriad of consumer goods rose Society became wealthier and could afford to fund the arts and the sciences

File:FlorentinoviruelaJPGEncounters between European explorers and Native Americans exposed the latter to a variety of diseases of extraordinary virulence Having migrated from Northeastern Asia 15000 years ago Native Americans had not been introduced to the plethora of contagious diseases that emerged after the rise of agriculture in the Old World As such they had immune systems that were illequipped to handle the diseases to which their counterparts in Eurasia had become resistant When the Europeans arrived in the Americas in short order the indigenous populations of the Americas found themselves facing smallpox measles whooping cough and the bubonic plague among others In tropical areas malaria yellow fever dengue fever Onchocerciasis
Similar events took place in Oceania and Madagascar There is an ongoing historical debate concerning two rival and irreconcilable theories about how the disease first entered the continent (see History of smallpox) Smallpox continued to be a deadly disease and killed an estimated 300 million people in the twentieth century alone but a vaccine the first of any kind had been available since 1796

As humans spread around the globe human societies flourish and become more dependent on trade and because urbanization means that people leave sparselypopulated rural areas for denselypopulated neighborhoods infectious diseases spread much more easily Outbreaks are frequent even in the modern era but medical advances have been able to alleviate their impacts In fact the human population grew tremendously in the twentieth century as did the population of farm animals from which diseases could Zoonosis


 Demographic dynamics 
Several key features of human societal collapse can be related to population dynamics For example the native population of Cusco Peru at the time of the Spanish conquest was stressed by an imbalanced Human sex ratioGender imbalance
There is strong evidence that humans also display population cycles Societies as diverse as those of England and France during the Roman medieval and early modern eras of Egypt during GrecoRoman and Ottoman rule and of various dynasties in China all showed similar patterns of political instability and violence becoming considerably more common after times of relative peace prosperity and sustained population growth Quantitatively periods of unrest included many times more events of instability per decade and occurred when the population was declining rather than increasing Preindustrial agrarian societies typically faced instability after one or two centuries of stability However a population approaching its carrying capacity alone is not enough to trigger general decline if the people remained united and the ruling class strong Other factors had to be involved such as having more aspirants for positions of the elite than the society could realistically support (elite overproduction) which led to social strife and chronic inflation which caused incomes to fall and threatened the fiscal health of the state Most historical periods of social unrest lacking in external triggers such as natural calamities and most genocides can be readily explained as a result of a builtup youth bulge As those trends intensified they jeopardized the social fabric which facilitated the decline

<! Changes occurring with collapse

There are three main types of collapse:

Reversion/Simplification: A societys adaptive capacity may be reduced by a rapid change in population or societal complexity both of which destabilize its institutions and cause massive shifts in population and other social dynamics In cases of collapse civilizations tend to revert to less complex less centralized sociopolitical forms using simpler technology These are characteristics of a Dark Ages in history
Incorporation/Absorption: Alternately a society may be gradually incorporated into a more dynamic more complex interregional social structure This happened in Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia the Eastern Roman Empire and Levant
Obliteration: Vast numbers of people in the society die or the birth rate plunges to a level that causes a dramatic depopulation

Other changes that may accompany a collapse:

Destratification: Complex societies stratified on the basis of class gender race or some other salient factor become much more homogeneous or horizontally structured In many cases past social stratification slowly becomes irrelevant after collapse and societies become more egalitarian
Despecialization: One of the most characteristic features of complex civilizations (and in many cases the yardstick to measure complexity) is a high level of division of laborDecentralization: As power becomes decentralized people tend to be more selfregimented and have many more personal freedoms In many instances of collapse there is a slackening of social rules and etiquette Geographically speaking communities become more parochial or isolated For example after the Classic Maya collapseDestructuralization: Institutions processes and artifacts are all manifest in the archaeological record in abundance in large civilizations After collapse the evidence of epiphenomena institutions and types of artifacts change dramatically since people are forced to adopt more selfsufficient lifestyles
Depopulation: Societal collapse is almost always associated with a population decline In extreme cases the collapse in population is so severe that the society disappears entirely which happened with the History of GreenlandDecadence: Sir John Bagot Glubb (18971987) a British military officer and historian in his essay Fate of Empires wrote that most empires tend to experience an age of decadence before they collapse

Theories
File:Île de Pâques  Moaïs au pied de la carrière 3775ajpgHistorical theories have evolved from being purely social and ethical to ideological and ethnocentric and finally to multidisciplinary studies They have become much more sophisticated

 Cognitive decline and loss of creativity 
The anthropologist Joseph Tainter theorized that collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs and were unable to adapt to natural diminishing returns for what they knew as their method of survival

 Social and environmental dynamics 
File:Temple of the Great JaguarjpgWhat produces modern sedentary life unlike nomadic huntergatherers is extraordinary modern economic productivity Tainter argues that exceptional productivity is actually more the sign of hidden weakness because of a societys dependence on it and its potential to undermine its own basis for success by not being selflimiting (biology)
As a population grows and technology makes it easier to exploit depleting resources the environments diminishing returns are hidden from view Societal complexity is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable and a disorderly reorganization were to follow The scissors model of Malthusian collapse in which the population grows without limit but not resources is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other

The complete breakdown of economic cultural and social institutions with ecological relationships is perhaps the most common feature of collapse In his book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed Jared Diamond proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other: nonsustainable exploitation of resources climate changes diminishing support from friendly societies hostile neighbors and inappropriate attitudes for change

 Energy return on investment 
Energy has played a crucial role throughout human history Energy is linked to the birth growth and decline of each and every society Energy surplus is required for the division of labor and the growth of cities Massive energy surplus is needed for widespread wealth and cultural amenities Economic prospects fluctuate in tandem with a societys access to cheap and abundant energy

Political scientist Thomas HomerDixon and ecologist Charles A S Hall
There would be no surplus if EROI approaches 1:1 Hall showed that the real cutoff is well above that and estimated that 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society The EROI of the most preferred energy source petroleum has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves An EROI of more than ~3 then is what appears necessary to provide the energy for socially important tasks such as maintaining government legal and financial institutions a transportation infrastructure manufacturing building construction and maintenance and the lifestyles of all members of a given society

The social scientist Luke Kemp indicated that alternative sources of energy such as solar panels have a low EROI because they have low energy density meaning they require a lot of land and require substantial amounts of rare earth metals to produce Hall and colleagues reached the same conclusion There is no onsite pollution but the EROI of renewable energy sources may be too low for them to be considered a viable alternative to fossil fuels which continue to provide the majority of the energy used by humans

The mathematician Safa Motesharrei and his collaborators showed that the use of nonrenewable resources such as fossil fuels allows populations to grow to one order of magnitude larger than they would using renewable resources alone and as such is able to postpone societal collapse However when collapse finally comes it is much more dramatic Tainter warned that in the modern world if the supply of fossil fuels were somehow cut off shortages of clean water and food would ensue and millions would die in a few weeks in the worsecase scenario

HomerDixon asserted that a declining EROI was one of the reasons that the Roman Empire declined and fell The historian Joseph Tainter made the same claim about the Maya Empire

Models of societal response
According to Joseph Tainter (1990) too many scholars offer facile explanations of societal collapse by assuming one or more of the following three models in the face of collapse:

 The Dinosaur a largescale society in which resources are being depleted at an exponential rate but nothing is done to rectify the problem because the ruling elite are unwilling or unable to adapt to those resources reduced availability In this type of society rulers tend to oppose any solutions that diverge from their present course of action but favor intensification and commit an increasing number of resources to their present plans projects and social institutions
 The Runaway Train a society whose continuing function depends on constant growth (cf Frederick Jackson Turners Frontier Thesis) This type of society based almost exclusively on acquisition (such as pillaging or exploitation) cannot be sustained indefinitely The ancient Assyrians The House of Cards a society that has grown to be so large and include so many complex social institutions that it is inherently unstable and prone to collapse This type of society has been seen with particular frequency among Eastern Bloc and other communist nations in which all social organizations are arms of the government or ruling party such that the government must either stifle association wholesale (encouraging dissent and Subversive:

Tainters critique
Tainter argues that those models though superficially useful cannot severally or jointly account for all instances of societal collapse Often they are seen as interconnected occurrences that reinforce one another

Tainter considers that social complexity is a recent and comparativelyanomalous occurrence requiring constant support He asserts that collapse is best understood by grasping four axioms In his own words (p&nbsp;194):

 human societies are problemsolving organizations;
 sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;
 increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita; and
 investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problemsolving response reaches a point of declining marginal returns

With those facts in mind collapse can simply be understood as a loss of the energy needed to maintain social complexity Collapse is thus the sudden loss of social complexity stratification internal and external communication and exchange and productivity

Toynbees theory of decay
In his acclaimed 12volume work A Study of History (1934–1961) the British historian Arnold J Toynbee explored the rise and fall of 28 civilizations and came to the conclusion that civilizations generally collapsed mainly by internal factors factors of their own making but external pressures also played a role He theorized that all civilizations pass through several distinct stages: genesis growth time of troubles universal state and disintegration

For Toynbee a civilization is born when a "creative minority" successfully responds to the challenges posed by its physical social and political environment However the fixation on the old methods of the "creative minority" leads it to eventually cease to be creative and degenerate into merely a "dominant minority" (that forces the majority to obey without meriting obedience) which fails to recognize new ways of thinking He argues that creative minorities deteriorate from a worship of their "former self" by which they become prideful and they fail in adequately addressing the next challenge that they face Similarly the German philosopher Oswald Spengler discussed the transition from Kultur to Zivilisation in his The Decline of the West (1918)

Toynbee argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a A Study of HistoryUniversal state


He argues that as civilizations decay they form an "Internal Proletariat" and an "External Proletariat" The Internal proletariat is held in subjugation by the dominant minority inside the civilization and grows bitter; the external proletariat exists outside the civilization in poverty and chaos and grows envious He argues that as civilizations decay there is a "schism in the body social" whereby abandon and selfcontrol together replace creativity and truancy and martyrdom together replace Apprenticeship
He argues that in that environment people resort to archaism (idealization of the past) Futures studies
The historian Carroll Quigley expanded upon that theory in The Evolution of Civilizations (1961 1979) He argued that societal disintegration involves the metamorphosis of social instruments which were set up to meet actual needs into institutions which serve their own interest at the expense of social needs However in the 1950s Toynbees approach to history his style of civilizational analysis started to face skepticism from mainstream historians who thought it put an undue emphasis on the divine which led to his academic reputation declining For a time however Toynbees Study remained popular outside academia Interest revived decades later with the publication of The Clash of Civilizations (1997) by the political scientist Samuel P Huntington who viewed human history as broadly the history of civilizations and posited that the world after the end of the Cold War will be multipolar and one of competing major civilizations which are divided by "fault lines"

Systems science
Developing an integrated theory of societal collapse that takes into account the complexity of human societies remains an open problem using systems thinking for careful storytelling about systemic organization and change

In the 1990s the evolutionary anthropologist and quantitative historian Peter Turchin noticed that the equations used to model the populations of predators and preys can also be used to describe the ontogeny of human societies He specifically examined how social factors such as income inequality were related to political instability He found recurring cycles of unrest in historical societies such as Ancient Egypt China and Russia He specifically identified two cycles one long and one short The long one what he calls the "secular cycle" lasts for approximately two to three centuries A society starts out fairly equal Its population grows and the cost of labor drops A wealthy upper class emerges and life for the working class deteriorates As inequality grows a society becomes more unstable with the lowerclass being miserable and the upperclass entangled in infighting Exacerbating social turbulence eventually leads to collapse The shorter cycle lasts for about 50 years and consists of two generations one peaceful and one turbulent Looking at US history for example Turchin identified times of serious sociopolitical instability in 1870 1920 and 1970 He announced in 2010 that he had predicted that in 2020 the US would witness a period of unrest at least on the same level as 1970 because the first cycle coincides with the turbulent part of the second in around 2020 He also warned that the US was not the only Western nation under strain

However Turchins model can only paint the broader picture and cannot pinpoint how bad things can get and what precisely triggers a collapse The mathematician Safa Motesharrei also applied predatorprey models to human society with the upper class and the lower class being the two different types of "predators" and natural resources being the "prey" He found that either extreme inequality or resource depletion facilitates a collapse However a collapse is irreversible only if a society experiences both at the same time as they "fuel each other"
