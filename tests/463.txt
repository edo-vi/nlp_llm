Poetry (a term derived from the Greek language
Poetry has a long and varied history of poetry
Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Classic of Poetry
Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry such as Aristotles Poetics (Aristotle)
Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential Aesthetic interpretation
Some poetry types are unique to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante Alighieri
Poets – as from the ancient Greek language
A Western culture
 In firstperson poems the lyrics are spoken by an "I" a character (arts)
History

Early works
Some scholars believe that the art of poetry may predate literacy and developed from folk epic poetryOthers however suggest that poetry did not necessarily predate writing

The oldest surviving epic poem the Epic of Gilgamesh dates from the 3rd millenniumBCE in Sumer (in Mesopotamia presentday Iraq) and was written in cuneiform script on clay tablets and later on papyrus The Istanbul 2461
Other ancient epics includes the Greek Iliad and the Odyssey; the Persian Avestan books (the Yasna); the Ancient Rome
Other forms of poetry including such ancient collections of religious hymns as the Indian Sanskritlanguage Rigveda the Avestan Gatha (Zoroaster)
The efforts of ancient thinkers to determine what makes poetry distinctive as a form and what distinguishes good poetry from bad resulted in "poetics"—the study of the aesthetics of poetry Some ancient societies such as Chinas through the Shijing developed canons of poetic works that had ritual as well as aesthetic importance More recently thinkers have struggled to find a definition that could encompass formal differences as great as those between Chaucers The Canterbury Tales
Until recently the earliest examples of stressed poetry had been thought to be works composed by Romanos the Melodist (fl 6th century CE) However Tim Whitmarsh writes that an inscribed Greek poem predated Romanos stressed poetry

Western traditions
File:Aristoteles LouvrejpgClassical thinkers in the Western cultureFile:John keatsjpgAristotles work was influential throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age as well as in Europe during the Renaissance Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from and defined it in opposition to prose which they generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure

This does not imply that poetry is illogical or lacks narration but rather that poetry is an attempt to render the beautiful or sublime without the burden of engaging the logical or narrative thoughtprocess English Romantic poetry
During the 18th and 19th centuries there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic traditions in part due to the spread of European colonialism and the attendant rise in global trade In addition to a boom in translation during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered

20thcentury and 21stcentury disputes
File:ArchibaldmacleishjpegSome 20thcentury Literary theory
The rejection of traditional forms and structures for poetry that began in the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry Numerous modernist poets have written in nontraditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and Tone (literature)
Postmodernism goes beyond modernisms emphasis on the creative role of the poet to emphasize the role of the reader of a text (hermeneutics) and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read Today throughout the world poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past further confounding attempts at definition and classification that once made sense within a tradition such as the Western canon

The early 21stcentury poetic tradition appears to continue to strongly orient itself to earlier precursor poetic traditions such as those initiated by Walt Whitman

Elements
Prosody

Prosody is the study of the meter rhythm and Intonation (linguistics)
Rhythm

File:Robinsonjeffers (cropped)jpgThe methods for creating poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by stresstimed language
Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called foot (prosody)
File:Marianne Moore 1935jpgThe chief device of ancient Hebrew language
Shi (poetry)
The formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry In the case of free verse rhythm is often organized based on looser units of Cadence (poetry)
Meter

File:Alkaios Sappho Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2416 n2jpgIn the Western poetic tradition meters are customarily grouped according to a characteristic Foot (prosody)
File:Homer British Museumjpg Iamb (poetry) trocheeone stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable (eg picture flower)
 dactyl (poetry) anapaesttwo unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable (eg comprehend)
 spondeetwo stressed syllables together (eg heartbeat fourteen)
 pyrrhictwo unstressed syllables together (rare usually used to end dactylic hexameter)

There are a wide range of names for other types of feet right up to a choriamb a four syllable metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek literature
Each of these types of feet has a certain "feel" whether alone or in combination with other feet The iamb for example is the most natural form of rhythm in the English language and generally produces a subtle but stable verse Scanning meter can often show the basic or fundamental pattern underlying a verse but does not show the varying degrees of stress (linguistics)
There is debate over how useful a multiplicity of different "feet" is in describing meter For example Robert Pinsky has argued that while dactyls are important in classical verse English dactylic verse uses dactyls very irregularly and can be better described based on patterns of iambs and anapests feet which he considers natural to the language Actual rhythm is significantly more complex than the basic scanned meter described above and many scholars have sought to develop systems that would scan such complexity Vladimir Nabokov noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words and suggested that the term "scud" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress

Metrical patterns

File:Lewis Carroll  Henry Holiday  Hunting of the Snark  Plate 6jpgDifferent traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes However a number of variations to the established meter are common both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition For example the stress in a foot may be inverted a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress) or the final foot in a line may be given a Meter (poetry)
File:Kiprensky PushkinjpgSome common metrical patterns with notable examples of poets and poems who use them include:
 Iambic pentameter (John Milton Paradise Lost; William Shakespeare Shakespeares Sonnets Dactylic hexameter (Homer Iliad; Virgil Aeneid)
 Iambic tetrameter (Andrew Marvell "To His Coy Mistress"; Alexander Pushkin Eugene Onegin; Robert Frost Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening)
 Trochaic octameter (Edgar Allan Poe "The Raven")
 Trochaic tetrameter (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The Song of Hiawatha; the Finnish national epic Kalevala  (Jean Racine Phèdre)

Rhyme alliteration assonance

File:Beowulf Cotton MS Vitellius A XV f 132rjpgRhyme alliteration assonance and Literary consonance
Rhyme consists of identical ("hardrhyme") or similar ("softrhyme") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at locations within lines ("internal rhyme") Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian for example has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms English with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages is less rich in rhyme The degree of richness of a languages rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language

Alliteration is the repetition of letters or lettersounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic Norse and Old English forms of poetry The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures

Assonance where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word was widely used in skaldic poetry but goes back to the Homeric epic Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element

Rhyming schemes

File:Paradiso Canto 31jpgIn many languages including Arabic and modern European languages poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms such as ballads sonnets and couplet
Most rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes so if the first second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line do not rhyme the quatrain is said to have an AA BA rhyme scheme This rhyme scheme is the one used for example in the rubaiyat form Similarly an A BB A quatrain (what is known as "enclosed rhyme") is used in such forms as the Petrarchan sonnet Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own separate from the "abc" convention such as the ottava rima and terza rima The types and use of differing rhyming schemes are discussed further in the rhyme scheme
Form in poetry
Poetic form is more flexible in modernist and postmodernist poetry and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras Many modern poets eschew recognizable structures or forms and write in free verse Free verse is however not "formless" but composed of a series of more subtle more flexible prosodic elements Thus poetry remains in all its styles distinguished from prose by form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in all varieties of free verse however much such structures may appear to have been ignored Similarly in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect

Among major structural elements used in poetry are the line the stanza or verse paragraph and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as cantos Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and calligraphy These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures called poetic forms or poetic modes (see the following section) as in the sonnet

Lines and stanzas

Poetry is often separated into lines on a page in a process known as line break (poetry)
Lines of poems are often organized into stanzas which are denominated by the number of lines included Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich) three lines a tercet
File:Alexander Blok  Noch ulica fonar aptekajpgOther poems may be organized into verse paragraphs in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms alliterations and rhymes established in paragraph form Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used

In many forms of poetry stanzas are interlocking so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas Examples of such interlocking stanzas include for example the ghazal and the villanelle where a refrain (or in the case of the villanelle refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem For example the strophe antistrophe and epode of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas

In some cases particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined In skaldic poetry the dróttkvætt stanza had eight lines each having three "lifts" produced with alliteration or assonance In addition to two or three alliterations the oddnumbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word) Each halfline had exactly six syllables and each line ended in a trochee The arrangement of dróttkvætts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dróttkvætts

Visual presentation

Even before the advent of printing the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem In Arabic poetry
With the advent of printing poets gained greater control over the massproduced visual presentations of their work Visual elements have become an important part of the poets toolbox and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes Some Modernism
Diction

Poetic diction treats the manner in which language is used and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry Register tone
Poetic diction can include rhetorical devices such as simile and metaphor as well as tones of voice such as irony Aristotle wrote in the Poetics (Aristotle)
Allegory
Another element of poetic diction can be the use of vivid imagery (literature)
Forms

File:Сортавала Рунопевец с кантелеjpgSpecific poetic forms have been developed by many cultures In more developed closed or "received" poetic forms the rhyming scheme meter and other elements of a poem are based on sets of rules ranging from the relatively loose rules that govern the construction of an elegy to the highly formalized structure of the ghazal or villanelle Described below are some common forms of poetry widely used across a number of languages Additional forms of poetry may be found in the discussions of the poetry of particular cultures or periods and in the Glossary of poetry terms
Sonnet

File:ShakespearejpgAmong the most common forms of poetry popular from the Late Middle Ages on is the sonnet which by the 13th century had become standardized as fourteen lines following a set rhyme scheme and logical structure By the 14th century and the Italian Renaissance the form had further crystallized under the pen of Petrarch whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by Thomas Wyatt (poet)
Sonnets of all types often make use of a volta or "turn" a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head a question is answered (or introduced) or the subject matter is further complicated This volta can often take the form of a "but" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines In the Petrarchan sonnet the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet

File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped)jpgSonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction vivid imagery and romantic love largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as Edmund Spenser (who gave his name to the Spenserian sonnet) Michael Drayton and Shakespeare whose Shakespeares sonnets
Shi

File:DufucalligraphyjpgShi () Is the main type of Classical Chinese poetry Within this form of poetry the most important variations are "folk song" styled verse (yuefu) "old style" verse (gushi (poetry)
Villanelle

File:AudenVanVechten1939jpgThe villanelle is a nineteenline poem made up of five triplets with a closing quatrain; the poem is characterized by having two refrains initially used in the first and third lines of the first stanza and then alternately used at the close of each subsequent stanza until the final quatrain which is concluded by the two refrains The remaining lines of the poem have an AB alternating rhyme The villanelle has been used regularly in the English language since the late 19th century by such poets as Dylan Thomas W H Auden and Elizabeth Bishop

Limerick

A limerick is a poem that consists of five lines and is often humorous Rhythm is very important in limericks for the first second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables However the third and fourth lines only need five to seven Lines 1 2 and 5 rhyme with each other and lines 3 and 4 rhyme with each other  Practitioners of the limerick included Edward Lear Alfred Lord Tennyson
Tanka

File:Kakinomoto HitomarojpgTanka is a form of unrhymed Japanese poetry with five sections totalling 31 On (Japanese prosody)
Haiku

Haiku is a popular form of unrhymed Japanese poetry which evolved in the 17th century from the hokku or opening verse of a renku Generally written in a single vertical line the haiku contains three sections totalling 17 on (Mora (linguistics)
:
:fuji no kaze ya oogi ni nosete Edo miyage
:the wind of Mt Fuji
:Ive brought on my fan!
:a gift from Edo

Khlong

The khlong ( ) is among the oldest Thai poetic forms This is reflected in its requirements on the tone markings of certain syllables which must be marked with mai ek (  ) or mai tho (  ) This was likely derived from when the Thai language had three tones (as opposed to todays five a split which occurred during the Ayutthaya Kingdom period) two of which corresponded directly to the aforementioned marks It is usually regarded as an advanced and sophisticated poetic form

In khlong a stanza (bot  ) has a number of lines (bat   from Pali and Sanskrit Pada (foot)
Khlong si suphap
The khlong si suphap ( ) is the most common form still currently employed It has four bat per stanza (si translates as four) The first wak of each bat has five syllables The second wak has two or four syllables in the first and third bat two syllables in the second and four syllables in the fourth Mai ek is required for seven syllables and Mai tho is required for four as shown below "Dead word (Thai language)
Ode

File:Quintus Horatius FlaccusjpgOdes were first developed by poets writing in ancient Greek such as Pindar and Latin such as Horace Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins The ode generally has three parts: a strophe an antistrophe and an epode The strophe and the antistrophe of the ode possess similar metrical structures and depending on the tradition similar rhyme structures In contrast the epode is written with a different scheme and structure Odes have a formal poetic diction and generally deal with a serious subject The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different often conflicting perspectives with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals) with the first reciting the strophe the second the antistrophe and both together the epode Over time differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode One nonWestern form which resembles the ode is the qasida in Arabic poetry

Ghazal

The  (also    or ) is a form of poetry common in Arabic poetry
As with other forms with a long history in many languages many variations have been developed including forms with a quasimusical poetic diction in Urdu Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form The relatively steady meter and the use of the refrain produce an incantatory effect which complements Sufi mystical themes well Among the masters of the form are Rumi the celebrated 13thcentury Persian poet and his equally famous nearcontemporary Hafez Hafez uses the ghazal to expose hypocrisy and the pitfalls of worldliness but also expertly exploits the form to express the divine depths and secular subtleties of love; creating translations that meaningfully capture such complexities of content and form is immensely challenging but lauded attempts to do so in English include Gertrude Bells Poems from the Divan of Hafiz and Beloved: 81 poems from Hafez (Bloodaxe Books) whose Preface addresses in detail the problematic nature of translating ghazals and whose versions (according to Fatemeh Keshavarz Roshan Institute for Persian Studies) preserve "that audacious and multilayered richness one finds in the originals" Indeed Hafezs ghazals have been the subject of much analysis commentary and interpretation influencing postfourteenth century Persian writing more than any other author The Westöstlicher Diwan of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe a collection of lyrical poems is inspired by the Persian poet Hafez

Genres
In addition to specific forms of poems poetry is often thought of in terms of different genres and subgenres A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter style or other broader literary characteristics Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature Others view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works
