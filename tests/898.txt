The Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature is a series of articles originally published in the Journal of the American Medical Association later rewritten and compiled in a textbook now in its third edition  The guides provide practical clinicianfriendly advice on all aspects of evidencebased medicine

As articles

During the late 1970s a group of clinical epidemiologists at McMaster University including Dr David Sackett prepared a series of articles to assist clinicians interpreting clinical research  These articles introducing the term "critical appraisal" appeared in the Canadian Medical Association Journal beginning in 1981

In 1990 Dr Gordon Guyatt introduced the term "evidencebased medicine" to stress the role of rigorous systematic evidence from clinical research in conjunction with patients’ values and preferences in clinical decisionmaking  A group of academic physicians subsequently formed the international Evidencebased Medicine Working Group and published a 1992 article announcing the "new paradigm" of evidencebased medicine

The Evidencebased Medicine Working Group decided to build on the popular series in the Canadian Medical Association Journal by creating a more practical approach to applying the medical literature to clinical practice  Championed by Dr Drummond Rennie an editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association the result was the Users Guides  The guides originally consisted of 25 topics covered in a series of 32 articles published in the Journal of the American Medical Association between 1993 and 2000 describing approaches to different types of medical questions and the study designs that may answer them

Books

Dr Guyatt and Dr Rennie edited the articles and compiled them to form a book titled Users Guides to the Medical Literature: A Manual for EvidenceBased Clinical Practice

The books teach a systematic approach to reading and applying the medical literature to individual patient care  It focuses on three questions: 1 Whether new information is likely to be valid 2 What the information says about patient care and 3 How the information can be used  To demonstrate the clinical relevance of the suggested approach each section begins with a practical clinical scenario  The chapter is then structured around identifying the best available evidence and applying the three key questions to the evidence in the context of the clinical scenario  Each chapter concludes with a resolution of the scenario

Most of the book chapters are based on specific types of clinical questions including questions of therapy harm diagnosis and prognosis  Other chapters deal with general skills that are important for all clinical questions such as “Finding the Evidence” “Summarizing the Evidence” and “Moving From Evidence to Action”

The Users Guides  come in two book versions: the Essentials introduces the concepts of evidencebased medicine (EBM) with which every practicing clinician should be familiar while the Manual provides a more comprehensive indepth exploration of  EBM concepts for clinicians seeking a deeper understanding or for those who wish to teach EBM

Website

The complete text of the second edition of the Users’ Guides Manual is available online by subscription The JAMAevidence website also includes a large number of calculators worksheets and additional aids for the practice of EBM including the updated and edited collection of another longrunning JAMA article series The Rational Clinical Examination: Evidencebased Clinical Diagnosis
