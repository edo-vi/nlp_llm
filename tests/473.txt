The 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak was the first modern largescale outbreak of cholera—a disease once considered beaten back largely due to the invention of modern sanitation The disease was reintroduced to Haiti in October 2010 not long after the disastrous 2010 Haitian earthquake
 Background 
File:Artibonite River in Haiti (2010)jpg
 Outbreak 
Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that when ingested can cause diarrhea and vomiting within several hours to 2–3 days Without proper treatment including oral rehydration cholera can be fatal The suspected source of Vibrio cholerae in Haiti was the Artibonite River from which most of the affected people had consumed the water Each year tens of thousands of Haitians bathe wash their clothes and dishes obtain drinking water and recreate in this river therefore resulting in high rates of exposure to Vibrio cholerae

The cholera outbreak began nine months after January 2010 earthquake leading some observers to wrongly suspect it was a result of the natural disaster However Haitians grew immediately suspicious of a UN peacekeeper base home to Nepalese peacekeepers positioned on a tributary of the Artibonite River Neighboring farmers reported an undeniable stench of human feces coming from the base to the extent that local Haitians began getting their drinking water upstream from the base In response United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti
For three months UN officials the CDC and others argued against investigating the source of the outbreak Gregory Hartl a spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO) said finding the cause of the outbreak was "not important" Hartl said "Right now there is no active investigation I cannot say one way or another if there will be It is not something we are thinking about at the moment What we are thinking about is the public health response in Haiti" Jordan Tappero the lead epidemiologist at the CDC said the main task was to control the outbreak not to look for the source of the bacteria and that "we may never know the actual origin of this cholera strain" A CDC spokesperson Kathryn Harben added that "at some point in the future when many different analyses of the strain are complete it may be possible to identify the origin of the strain causing the outbreak in Haiti"

Paul Farmer cofounder of the medical organization Partners In Health and a UN official himself who served Bill Clintons deputy at the Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti told the APs Katz on 3 November 2010 that there was no reason to wait Farmer stated "The idea that wed never know is not very likely Theres got to be a way to know the truth without pointing fingers" A cholera expert John Mekalanos supported the assertion that it was important to know where and how the disease emerged because the strain is a "novel virulent strain previously unknown in the Western Hemisphere and health officials need to know how it spreads"

Some US professors have disagreed with the contention that Nepalese soldiers caused the outbreak Some said it was more likely dormant cholera bacteria had been aroused by various environmental incidents in Haiti Before studying the case they said a sequence of events including changes in climate triggered by the El NiñoSouthern Oscillation
However a study unveiled in December and conducted by French epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux contended that UN troops from Nepal rather than environmental factors had started the epidemic as waste from outhouses at their base flowed into and contaminated the Artibonite River A separate study published in December in the New England Journal of Medicine presented DNA sequence data for the Haitian cholera isolate finding that it was most closely related to a cholera strain found in Bangladesh in 2002 and 2008 It was more distantly related to existing South American strains of cholera the authors reported adding that "the Haitian epidemic is probably the result of the introduction through human activity of a V cholerae strain from a distant geographic source"

Under intense pressure the UN relented and said it would appoint a panel to investigate the source of the cholera strain That panels report issued in May 2011 confirmed substantial evidence that the Nepalese troops had brought the disease to Haiti The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) utilized DNA fingerprinting to tests various samples of cholera from Haitian patients to pinpoint the specific strand of cholera found in Haiti During an epidemiological outbreak investigation DNA fingerprinting of bacteria can be extremely helpful in identifying the source of an outbreak The results of the CDC tests showed that the specific strain of cholera found in samples taken from Haitian patients was Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 serotype Ogawa a strain found in South Asia This specific strain of cholera is endemic in Nepal therefore supporting the Haitian suspicion that Nepalese peacekeepers were the source of the outbreak However in the reports concluding remarks the authors stated that a "confluence of circumstances" was to blame

Rita Colwell former director of the National Science Foundation and climate change expert still contends that climate changes were an important factor in choleras spread stating in an interview with UNEARTH News in August 2013 that the outbreak was "triggered by a complicated set of factors The precipitation and temperatures were above average during 2010 and that in conjunction with a destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure can be considered to have contributed to this major disease outbreak"

In August 2016 after Katz obtained a leaked copy of a report by United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston Ban Kimoon
 Reactions 
At the beginning of the outbreak widespread panic regarding the virulence of the disease and the UNs denial of the blame caused increased tension between the UN and the Haitian community On 15 November 2010 a riot broke out in CapHaïtien following the death of a young Haitian inside the CapHaïtien UN base and rumours that the outbreak was caused by UN soldiers from Nepal Protesters demanded that the Nepalese brigade of the UN leave the country At least five people were killed in the riots including one UN personnel Riots then continued for a second day Following the riots the UN continued their position that the Nepalese soldiers were not to blame and rather said that the riots was being staged for "political reasons because of forthcoming elections" as the Haitian government sent its own forces to "protest" the UN peacekeepers According to one author rather than confront the inescapable conclusion that the UN was indeed the cause "the worlds preeminent humanitarian organization continued to dissemble" During a third day of riots UN personnel were blamed for shooting at least five protestors but denied responsibility On the fourth day of demonstrations against the UN presence police fired tear gas into an internally displaced people
The outbreak of cholera became an issue for Haitian candidates to answer in the Haitian general election 2010
In November 2011 the UN received a petition from 5000 victims for hundreds of millions of dollars in reparations over the outbreak thought to have been caused by UN members of MINUSTAH In February 2013 the United Nations responded by invoking its immunity from lawsuits under the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations On 9 October 2013 Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI) the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti (IJDH) and civil rights lawyer Ira Kurzban
"Imagine if the United Nations killed thousands on the streets of New York Or London Or Paris And sickened nearly a million more Would the UN claim it was not liable? Of course not The international community wouldnt allow it"

A lead lawyer for the plaintiffs also noted that the lawsuit was different from the one filed by the IDJH in that it alleged that liability had been accepted by the UN the 1990s The lawyer stated that immunity: "should not be a shield to hide behind because the United Nations (or the US government) doesnt like the price tag that comes with the UNs indisputable gross negligence in this case"

This case too was dismissed by the US District Court and the Court of Appeals The appeal is currently before the Supreme Court of the United States
In December 2016 the then UN SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon finally apologized on behalf of UN saying he was "profoundly sorry" for the outbreak The SecretaryGeneral promised to spend $400 million to aid the victims and to improve the nations crumbling sanitation and water systems As of March 2017 the UN has come through with only 2 percent of that amount

Morbidity and mortality
 Domestic 
On 21 October 2010 the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) confirmed the first case of cholera in Haiti in over a century It had killed 4672 people by March 2011 and hospitalized thousands more

By January 2013 more than 6% of Haitians acquired the disease The highest incidence of cholera occurred in 2011 immediately following the introduction of the primary exposure The rate of incidence slowly declined thereafter with spikes resulting from rainy seasons and hurricanes As reported by the Haitian Health Ministry as of August 2012 the outbreak had caused 586625 cholera cases and 7490 deaths According to the Pan American Health Organization as of 21 November 2013 there had been 689448 cholera cases in Haiti leading to 8448 deaths While there had been an apparent lull in cases in 2014 by August 2015 the rainy season brought a spike in the number of cases At that time more than 700000 Haitians had become ill with the disease and the death toll had climbed to 9000 As of March 2017 around 7% of Haitis population (around 800665 people) have been affected with cholera and 9480 Haitians have died Latest epidemiological report by WHO in 2018 indicate a total of 812586 cases of cholera in Haiti since October 2010 resulting in 9606 deaths

However a 2011 serological survey indicated that a large number of patients may have not been diagnosed: while only 18% of over a 2500 respondents in a rural commune reported a cholera diagnosis 64% had antibodies against it

 International 
The first case of cholera was reported in the Dominican Republic in midNovember 2010 following the PanAmerica Health Organizations prediction By January 2011 the Dominican Republic had reported 244 cases of cholera The first man to die of it there died in the province of Altagracia on 23 January 2011 The Dominican Republic was particularly vulnerable to exposure of cholera due to sharing a border with Haiti and a large Haitian refugee population displaced following the 2010 earthquake As of the latest epidemiological report by WHO in 2018 there has been a total of 33188 cases of cholera in the Dominican Republic resulting in 504 deaths

In late January 2011 more than 20 Venezuelans were reported to have been taken to hospital after contracting cholera after visiting the Dominican Republic 37 cases were reported in total Venezuelan health minister Eugenia Sader gave a news conference which was broadcast on Venezolana de Televisión
In late June 2012 Cuba confirmed three deaths and 53 cases of cholera in Manzanillo Cuba
 Vulnerabilities 
 Infrastructure 
Before the outbreak Haiti suffered from relatively poor public health and sanitation infrastructure In 2002 Haiti was ranked 147th out of 147 countries for water security As of 2008 37% of Haitis population lacked access to adequate drinking water and 83% lacked improved sanitation facilities As such families often obtain their water from natural sources such as rivers that may be contaminated with V cholerae Poor sanitation infrastructure allows cholera bacterium to enter these waterways Persons are subsequently infected via the fecaloral route when the water is used for drinking and cooking and poor hygiene often contributes to the spread of cholera through the household or community There is also a chronic shortage of health care personnel and hospitals lack adequate resources to treat those infected with cholera a situation that became readily apparent after January 2010 earthquake Insufficient water and sanitation infrastructure coupled with a massive earthquake in 2010 made Haiti particularly vulnerable to an outbreak of waterborne disease

 Physiological 
Malnutrition of the population another preexisting condition that was exacerbated by the earthquake may have also contributed to the severity of the outbreak Furthermore Haitians had no biological immunity to the strain of cholera introduced since they had no previous exposure to it Therefore physiological factors including malnutrition and lack of immunity may have allowed cholera to spread rapidly throughout the country

 Information 
Lack of information and limited access to some rural areas can also be a barrier to care Some aid agencies have reported that mortality and morbidity tolls may be higher than the official figures because the government does not track deaths in rural areas where people never reached a hospital or emergency treatment center Limitations in the data from Haiti stem from a lack of preoutbreak lack of surveillance infrastructure and laboratories to properly test samples and diagnose cases Haiti was tasked with developing surveillance systems and laboratories after the 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak which caused difficulties tracking the progression and scale of the outbreak  Because of the lack of established surveillance much of the case report data is anecdotal and potentially underestimated  Also because of lack of laboratory confirmation for the vast majority of cases of cholera it is possible that other diarrheal diseases were being falsely classified as cholera

 Environmental 
Rainy seasons and hurricanes continue to cause a temporary spike in incident cases and deaths Moreover as a result of global warming and climate change Haiti is at an increased risk of cholera transmission The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) advances that global warming between 15–2 degrees Celsius will very likely lead to an increase in frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather events Resourcepoor countries are poised to be affected more so than more developed and economically secure countries

Environmental factors such as temperature increases severe weather events and natural disasters have a twofold impact on the transmission potential of cholera in Haiti: 1) they present conditions favorable to the persistence and growth of V cholerae in the environment and 2) they devastate a countrys infrastructure and strain public health and health care resources An exhaustive study into environmental factors influencing the spread of cholera in Haiti cites above average air temperatures following the earthquake "anomalously high rainfall" from September to October 2010 and damage to the limited water and sanitation infrastructure as likely converging to create conditions favorable to a cholera outbreak

 Challenges and solutions to eradication 
Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been dedicated towards eradicating cholera in Haiti since its introduction in 2010 yet unsanitary conditions and climatedriven forces allow cholera transmission to continue While the number of new cases of cholera has drastically decreased from 2010 and is currently the lowest it has been since the outbreak began the incidence remains at 255 per 100000 population as of October 2018

After former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon accepted UN responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti in December 2016 Moon projected a necessary $400 million in funding over two years in order to fully eradicate cholera in Haiti&nbsp; The Government of Haiti has dedicated itself to the complete eradication of cholera from Haiti by 2022 as presented in the Cholera Elimination Plan (PNEC) 2013 – 2022 UN SecretaryGeneral António Guterres successor to Ban Kimoon took up Bans commitment to assist Haiti in the eradication of cholera when he took office on 31 December 2016 as demonstrated by strategic objective 2 of the 2017– 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan Strategic objective 2 reads "Save lives from epidemics – Reduce mortality and morbidity due to cholera outbreaks and other waterborne diseases through the reduction of vulnerability strengthening of epidemiological surveillance and ensuring of rapid and effective response"&nbsp; The 2017 – 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan identifies 19 million people in need of assistance for the protection from cholera of which 15 million people are targeted through programming totaling US$217 million&nbsp; Currently the UN and Government of Haiti are on target to reach the 2016 – 2018 midterm goal to reduce the incidence of cholera to less than 01% by the end of 2018&nbsp;However any disruption in funding of support services may result in a spike in transmission and the interruption of the downward trend

 Challenges 
 Protracted crises: Hurricane Matthew 2016 
The first challenge to the eradication of cholera in Haiti is the countrys vulnerability to disasters putting it in a state of protracted crises The climax of cholera incidence in Haiti was in 2011 with 352000 new cases following the introduction of cholera in Haiti in late 2010

 Funding 
While the Government of Haitis Cholera Elimination Plan (PNEC) 2013 – 2022 and the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti (see solutions below for more information) lay out plans for the elimination of cholera in Haiti by 2022 these are entirely dependent on funding In former Secretary General Moons 5 December 2016 remarks he says "Without political will and financial support from the membership of the United Nations we have only good intentions and words Words are powerful – but they cannot replace action and material support"

As of 2017 funding for cholera is at risk due to increasing food insecurity and shelter needs for Haitian refugees returning from the Dominican Republic In the 2017 – 2018 Revised Haiti Humanitarian Plan funding requirements for cholera programming is the third largest at $217 million behind $766 million for food security and $1038 million for shelter/NFI needs

 Solutions 
 Vaccination campaigns 
In 2013 the Government of Haiti launched an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign in two regions: Cerca Carvajal and Petite Anse These regions were chosen because of particularly high attack rates sanitation infrastructure and access to healthcare This vaccination effort was slightly controversial because the WHO guidelines at the time did not encourage mass vaccination campaigns in areas where outbreaks had already occurred Prior to the 2010 outbreak in Haiti vaccination campaigns were thought to detract from more important prevention measures like water treatment and good hygiene Relative success rates (up to 65% or higher protective effectiveness 5 years after vaccination) in recent vaccination campaigns in Haiti and other countries affected by cholera has led to more widespread use of oral cholera vaccine programs and a change in the WHO guidelines to encourage use of vaccines in addition to other prevention and treatment strategies

 UN approach 
At the end of 2016 former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon presented the "New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti" This twotrack approach marked the UNs acceptance of responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti and demonstrated its commitment to the eradication of the disease in Haiti Since the 2016 admission of guilt there has been increased coordination and goodwill between the Government of Haiti and UN resulting in great strides towards the elimination of cholera 2017 was a hallmark year in the elimination of cholera from Haiti The 2017 – 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan reports "As of 31 December 2017 13682 suspected cholera cases and 150 deaths had been registered in the country in 2017 compared to 41955 cases and 451 deaths for the same period in 2016 a decrease of 67% in both cases"&nbsp;Newly developed rapid response teams are largely to credit for the reduction in disease incidence

The ability for the humanitarian sector to act quickly and bounce back following Hurricane Matthew in 2016 as well as to maintain the downward trend during the heavy rain season demonstrates progress in the eradication of cholera in Haiti

 Track 1 
Track 1 of the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti aims to "intensify efforts to respond to and reduce the incidence of cholera in Haiti" through three main projects&nbsp; The first is strengthening and supporting the rapid response framework developed by the Haitian Government which deploys to communities where cholera is suspected within 48hours There are currently 13 government led rapid response teams and 60 mobile teams of humanitarian actors that support the rapid response teams The goal of rapid response teams is to cut the transmission of cholera by first setting up a perimeter called a Cordon sanitaire (medicine)
The second project of track 1 is the continued support of oral cholera vaccination campaigns as a preventative measure&nbsp; In 2018 the oral cholera vaccine campaign will focus on departments with the highest incidence of disease particularly Artibonite and Centre departments

The final aim of track 1 is to "more effectively address… the medium/longer term issues of water sanitation and health systems" The "New Way of Working" aims to draw from funding sources on both sides of the spectrum both development and humanitarian to work towards the Sustainable Development Goals&nbsp; No joint funded projects have been reported in Haiti yet

 Track 2 
The second track of the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti proposes to provide material assistance to individuals and families who were most affected by cholera&nbsp; The material assistance package is the UNs attempt at reparations after accepting responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti The UN reports "nearly 800000 Haitians have been infected by cholera since 2010 as of 2016 and more than 9000 have died"&nbsp; First consultations will be conducted with the community to identify what materials will be of greatest impact

2020 Update:

            January of this year marked the 10year anniversary of the devastating earthquake in Haiti  In addition to the lives lost in the earthquake thousands of lives have been affected by the introduction of Cholera to Haiti by UN peacekeepers in Nepal It is estimated that over the last ten years 820000 cases and nearly 10000 deaths have been reported as of January 18 2020 We briefly describe an update on the cholera epidemic in Haiti since 2016

           In 2015 Haiti had more reported cases of cholera per population than any other country and in 2016 Hurricane Matthew added a new urgency to mitigating the suffering in Haiti due to Cholera In the same year the UN apologized to the Haitian people for the epidemic after scientific studies linked the cholera epidemic to UN peacekeepers that were not screened for the disease prior to their arrival in Haiti after the earthquake and pledged to provide 400 million dollars in two years to implement "Track 1" and "Track 2" aimed at providing water sanitation and improved access to treatment

While to date only 5% of the funds for these tracks have been raised ongoing humanitarian efforts by the UN other NGOs and the Haitian government the new cases of Cholera have drastically decreased in the last 5 years  A series of studies from 2013 to 2016 proved that the combination of chlorination and cholera vaccination could eliminate cholera in one of the poorest areas in Haiti Then in October 2016 the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population requested and received 1 million doses of the oral cholera vaccine partially funded by Gavi the vaccine alliance These and ongoing efforts by the Haitian government and humanitarian aid have only continued to decrease the number of cholera cases in Haiti In 2018 only 3700 cholera cases and 41 deaths were reported from 90% of the departments in Haiti Then in 2019 the UN announced that Haiti had been cholera free for one year with the last confirmed case reported to be in the Artibonite in January 2019 However  in order to obtain validation that cholera has ended in Haiti the country must maintain effective surveillance systems and remain cholera free for two more years
