A literal music video also called a literal video version is a satirical remix of an official music video clip in which the lyrics have been replaced with lyrics that describe the visuals in the video

Literal video versions are usually based on music videos in which the imagery appears illogical disconnected with the lyrics and more concerned with impressive visuals than actual meaning Most of the literal videos have been based on music videos from the 1980s and 1990s

The versions of "Take On Me" and "Total Eclipse of the Heart" have seen millions of views on YouTube and have created a brief resurgence of the original song in the popular culture In the concepts first year YouTube has hosted 100 different "literal version" videos from users all over the world including foreign language entries

Conception

The first known example of this meme a redub of Ahas "Take on Me" was posted on YouTube by Dustin McLean in his nowdefunct channel Dusto McNeato in October 2008 McLean who worked on the animated SuperNews! show on Current TV stated that the idea for literal videos came about from an inside joke with his fellow workers

In the two months after "Take On Me" was posted ten other YouTube users began making literal versions of their own The most popular of these initial nonMcLean videos was a redub of Rick Astleys "Never Gonna Give You Up" by copyrighthater which went on to receive over two million views in its first year online The new lyrics give a nod to "Rickrolling" a previous internet meme that involved tricking people into watching the original video of the same song
