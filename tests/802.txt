Issues related to race and sports have been examined by scholars for a long time Among these issues are racial discrimination in sports as well as the observation that there are overrepresentations and underrepresentations of different Race (classification of human beings)
 Participation and performance disparities 

 Sprinting 
In 1991 Namibian (formerly SouthWest Africa) Frankie Fredericks became the first sub10second 100 metres runner of nonWest African heritage and in 2003 Australias Patrick Johnson (sprinter)
In 2010 France
Olympic 100&nbsp;m medallists in the early phase of the Modern Olympic Games were principally white people
Eddie Tolan became the first nonwhite winner of the event in 1932 and this signified the start of a prolonged period of success by black male sprinters; since 1932 only five mens Olympic champions in the event have not had significant African heritage The womens event was dominated by runners of European descent until Wilma Rudolph won the title in 1960 Soviet and German women returned to the podium in the period from 1972 to 1980 but since then AfricanAmerican and Jamaican women have won the great majority of 100&nbsp;m medals

In the Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Mens 100 metres
 Endurance running 
Many Nilotic peoples
Joseph L Graves argues that Kenyan athletes from the African Great Lakes region who have done well in long distance running all have come from highaltitude areas whereas those from lowaltitude areas do not perform particularly well He also argues that Koreans and Ecuadorians from highaltitude areas compete well with Kenyans in longdistance races According to Graves this suggests that it is the fact of having trained in a high altitude combined with possible local level physiological adaptations to highaltitude environments that is behind the success in long distance running not race

Graves also argues that while it is superficially true that most of the world recordholders in the 100meter dash are of West African heritage they also all have partial genetic heritage from Europe and Native America they have also all trained outside of West Africa and West African nations have not trained any toplevel runners Graves says these factors make it impossible to say to which degree the success is best attributed to genetic or to environmental factors But later Graves found it possible: "Endurance runners are more likely to come from East Africa and sprinters from West Africa That’s a fact Genes play a major role in this”

 Views in the United States 
Various individuals including scholars and sportswriters have commented on the apparent overrepresentations and underrepresentations of different races in different sports African Americans accounted for 75% of players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) near the end of 2008 According to the latest National Consortium for Academics and Sports equality report card 65% of National Football League players were African Americans However in 2008 about 85% of Major League Baseball players were African American (who make up about 13% of the US population) and 291% were Hispanics of any race (compared with about 16% of the US population)

NCAA sports have mirrored the trends present in American professional sports During the 2005–2006 season black males comprised 469 percent of NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and 589 percent of NCAA Division I basketball The NCAA statistics show a strong correlation between percentage of black athletes within a sport and the revenue generated by that sport For example University of North Carolinas 2007–2008 mens basketball team (the team was 59% black relative to the 37% black population of the institution as a whole) generated $17215199 in revenue which comprised 30 percent of the schools athletic revenue for the year Given NCAA rules prohibiting the payment of players some have come to see the structure of NCAA athletics as exploitative of college athletes Some believe that since black athletes comprise a high percentage of athletes in high revenue college sports (FBS football and Division I Mens basketball) they are therefore the biggest losers in this arrangement  Billy Hawkins argues that "the control over the Black males body and profiting off its physical expenditure is in the hands of White males" His position refers to a very high percentage of Division I universities controlled by white administrations that prosper greatly from the free labor produced by the revenue sports that are heavily populated by black athletes This claim is substantiated by statistics such as the 2005–2006 NCAA Division I mens basketball tournament in which games started and minutes played for black athletes were over double that of their white counterparts with 687 percent of scoring in the tournament coming from black players

Despite the frequency of such speculation suggestions of biological differences in athletic ability between racial groups are considered unscientific

 "Black athletic superiority" 
"Black athletic superiority" is the theory that black people possess certain Phenotypic trait
Various hypotheses regarding racial differences of black people
In 1971 AfricanAmerican sociology
 "East Asian athletic views" 
In the United States Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States
In American sports there has been a higher representation of Asian American athletes who are of mixed racial heritage in comparison to those of full racial heritage such as former football player Roman Gabriel who was the first AsianAmerican to start as an NFL quarterback Another fact to note is that a majority of Asian American athletes who are currently drafted/recruited to compete professionally tend to be in sports that require little to no contact

 Chinese views 
The idea among Chinese people that "genetic differences" cause Asian athletes to be "slower at sprinting" than their American African or European rivals is "widely accepted" The Peoples Daily a Chinese newspaper wrote that Chinese are "suited" to sports that draw upon "agility and technique" such as table tennis badminton Diving (sport)
Li Aidong a researcher with the China Institute of Sports Science said that sports coaches believed that Chinese athletes could have success in long jumping high jumping and race walking However Li doubted that Chinese could compete in "pure sprint (running)
 Explanations for participation and performance disparities 

 Physiological factors 

A 1994 examination of 32 English sport/exercise science textbooks found that seven suggested that there are biophysical differences due to race that might explain differences in sports performance one expressed caution with the idea and the other 24 did not mention the issue

 Socioeconomic factors 
In Stuck in the Shallow End: Education Race and Computing UCLA researcher Jane Margolis outlines the history of segregation in swimming in the United States to show how people of colour have been affected up to the present day by inadequate access to swimming facilities and Swimming lessons
 Haplogroup inheritance 
Elite athletic capacity has also been correlated with differing patterns of haplogroup inheritance Moran et al (2004) observed that among YDNA (paternal) clades borne by elite endurance athletes in Ethiopia the Haplogroup EP2
Citing haplogroup data from various previous studies Ahmetov and Fedotovskaya (2012) report that the Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup
 Racial prejudices discrimination segregation and integration 


The baseball color line which included separate Negro league baseball was one example of racial segregation in the United States

In the United States a study found that a form of racial discrimination exists in NBA basketball as white players received higher salaries than do blacks related to actual performance <!When?  How many?  Criteria?> Funk says this may be due to viewer discrimination Viewership increases when there is greater participation by white players which means higher advertising incomes This explains much of the salary gap<ref nameFunk2001>cite journal
</ref>

Researchers have looked at other evidence for sports consumer discrimination One method is comparing the price of sports memorabilia such as baseball cards Another is looking at fan voting for allstar teams Still another is looking at willingness to attend sporting events The evidence is mixed with some studies finding bias against blacks and others not A bias if it exists may be diminishing and possibly disappearing according to a study on fan voting for baseball allstar teams

 Major League Baseball 


Jackie Robinson was the first African American to play a major league game on April 15 1947 Jackie loved the sport of baseball but that wasnt his only goal to make the majors He wanted to make a way for more African Americans to join the league However with struggles of people being racist in the stands players spouting off racial slang words to other players or fans etc Jackie wasnt discouraged to the hate as he was not only one of the best African Americans to play the game but one of the best in the history of baseball


The underrepresentation of Blacks in US baseball ended during the early years of the civil rights movement The representation of different races in Major League Baseball has been increasing since 1947 according to Mark Armour and Daniel R Levitt of the Society for American Baseball Research According to their research African American representation reached its peak in 1984 when it reached 184% However the African American representation has been steadily decreasing since that point As of 2016 the African American representation was down to 67%

According to Armour and Levitt the Latino representation has been steadily increasing since 1947 That year the representation was only at 07% Since that time the Latino representation in baseball has increased substantially As of 2016 the Latino representation was at 274%

Asian American representation in baseball has been much less abundant throughout the games history according to Armour and Levitt Their representation in the Major League did not get over 1% until 1999 when their representation was at 12% While the representation is increasing it is doing so significantly slower than the other races As of 2016 Asian American representation was only at 21% a small increase from 1999

According to Armour and Levitt Whites make up the largest portion of the different races represented in the Major League However their representation has been steadily declining as the African American Asian and Latino representation has been steadily on the rise The Society for American Baseball research shows that white representation was at 983% in 1947 Since then representation has decreased to 637% in 2016

In a journal titled Using Giddenss Structuration Theory to Examine the Waning Participation of African Americans in Baseball it says "Numerous studies have shown that AfricanAmerican youths are more likely than Whites to be encouraged and even directed to play basketball over other sports"

 National Basketball Association 

Although JapaneseAmerican Wataru Misaka broke the National Basketball Associations color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks 1950 is recognized as the year the NBA integrated That year AfricanAmerican players joined several teams; they included Chuck Cooper (basketball)
In another example from an interview with National Basketball Association
 National Football League 

Black players participated in the National Football League from its inception in 1920; however there were no AfricanAmerican players from 1933 to 1946 There is a great deal of speculation as to why this "gentlemans agreement" as it came to be called was implemented during this era Some argue that it was purely because of the Great Depression Jobs were difficult to come by and thus race relations became increasingly strained as AfricanAmericans and other minorities became perceived as "threats" Finally in 1946 the Los Angeles Rams broke this unofficial "agreement" and drafted Kenny Washington along with Woody Strode in the same year The final NFL team to break this agreement was the Washington Redskins who signed Bobby Mitchell in 1962

In October 2018 George Taliaferro the first African American who played in the NFL died at the age of 91 While George was the first African American drafted to play in the NFL the first African American would not be drafted as the Quarterback until 1953 when Willie Thrower was drafted to play with the Chicago Bears It wouldnt be for another 14 years 1967 until the first African American Emlen Tunnell would be elected for the NFL Hall of Fame

 National Hockey League 

On November 16 1926 Native American Taffy Abel joined the New York Rangers breaking the NHL color barrier and making history as the first ever Native American to play in the National Hockey League since its founding in 1917 On January 18 1958 Willie ORee joined the Boston Bruins in a game against the Montreal Canadiens  making history as the first ever black person to play in the National Hockey League  Some 16 years later Mike Marson became the second black player to join the league with his expansion to the Washington Capitals Decades later a 2020 analysis revealed that Person of color
Though black people are evidently underrepresented in the National Hockey League this is not at all reflective of their involvement in the sport and its development In 1895–22 years before the establishment of the National Hockey League—the Colored Hockey League took form in Nova Scotia Canada This was hockeys first ever organized league and at its peak contained hundreds of players throughout more than a dozen teams The season ran from late January to early March as they were only allowed access to the ice rinks when the whiteonly leagues finished their seasons leaving the Colored Hockey League with the worst of the ice conditions and subsequently with a much shorter season Political and racial tensions forced the league to disintegrate in 1905 as they were no longer allowed to use arenas at all regardless of the time of year In 1921 the league reformed on a smaller scale with just three teams but struggled to gain and keep traction By the mid1930s the National Hockey League had become hugely popular while the Colored Hockey League had disappeared altogether

Despite the many barriers imposed on the Colored Hockey League they were reportedly just as competitive as the whiteonly leagues while demonstrating a faster and more aggressive style of play and making revolutionary contributions to the sport The illustrious slapshot for example was invented by Colored Hockey League star Eddie Martin and later popularized by white players in the National Hockey League Additionally Henry "Braces" Franklyn was the first goalie to go down on to the ice to make saves; this butterfly style was also popularized many years later by white players and remains a staple of the modern game

 Professional Golfers Association 
In 1961 the "Caucasians only" clause was struck from the Professional Golfers Association of America constitution

Throughout the games history golf has not included many AfricanAmerican players and they were often denied the opportunity to golf However many found a way to play the game anyway According to an article by the AfricanAmerican Registry titled AfricanAmericans and Golf a Brief History "the Professional Golf Association of America (PGA) fought hard and until 1961 successfully maintained its allwhite status Black golfers (then) created their own organization of touring professionals"

Tiger Woods has had a major impact on the game of golf especially among minorities The article AfricanAmericans and Golf a Brief History states "With the ascent of Tiger Woods and his golf game comes an increased interest and participation from young minorities in the game He himself envisions this impacting in the next ten years as they come of age and develop physically as well" Woods hopes minority participation will continue to increase in the future

The research surrounding descriptions employed about White and Black athletes in the media and how the stereotypes of Black athletes has affected Tiger Woods in a majority white sport because Tiger Woods was the only Black golfer on the PGA tour he received different comments related to Black stereotypes that the other golfers on the tour did not

African American participation in golf has been increasing In a journal titled African American Culture and Physical Skill Development Programs: The Effect on Golf after Tiger Woods it says "Smith (1997) reported data from a National Golf Foundation (NDF) study in the United States indicating there are 676000 AfricanAmerican golfers (27% of the 247 million golfers)"

As AfricanAmerican participation increased Asian participation in professional golf has also increased According to an article by Golfweek titled Record Number of Asian Golfers Compete for Masters Glory there were 10 golfers which was a tournament record

According to the article Where are all the black golfers? Nearly two decades after Tiger Woods arrival golf still struggles to attract minorities As of 2013 there were 257 million golfers: this was composed of 203 million whites 31 million Hispanics 13 million AfricanAmericans and 1 million AsianAmericans The lack of diversity is still very apparent in golf today

 Positions of power: coaching and administration 
Referring to quarterbacks head coaches and athletic directors Kenneth L Shropshire of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has described the number of African Americans in "positions of power" as "woefully low"  The lack of minorities in positions of leadership has been attributed to racial stereotypes as well "old boy networks" and white administrators business networking
With an inadequate number of minorities in executive positions in the NFL the NFL decided to revise the Rooney Rule to include teams to interview minorities for general manager positions There has been backlash on how effective this rule has been and if there needs to be more revisions to this rule As of 2022 there are only six minority head coaches in the NFL: Lovie Smith Mike Tomlin Ron Rivera Robert Saleh Todd Bowles and Mike McDaniel Because of racial discrimination which AAP News & Journal defines as "a form of social inequality that includes experiences resulting from legal and nonlegal systems of discrimination" it has resulted in unequal outcomes and a power struggle A vast majority of the representation of minority coaches are held at positional or assistant coaches With a lot of people minorities competing for head coaching positions with only a limited supply it allows the very few minority head coaches to get handsomely salaries while the rest get average or low pay Not only are finances an issue the talent that is being presented is ultimately looked over because minorities coaches are not being hired and the NFL is meeting their status quo of at least interviewing minorities for head coaching and general manager positions Social networks also play a big role in how coaches are hired

The power dynamics between the owners and players in the NFL has created racial inequality between the two groups 30 owners are white while only two owners are of color (one is from Pakistan and one is Asian American) Richard Roth sports attorney who has represented Peyton Manning claimed "22 of the teams in the NFL have been owned by the same person or family for at least 20 years" Dr Richard Lapchick director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports claimed "Who owners invite into their fraternityand its overwhelmingly a fraternityis selfselective" Due to wealth inequality in the United States there are few black billionaires who could be potential candidates Furthermore from a social class standpoint it is very difficult for there to be a black owner as "very few black people are part of these billionaires boys clubs"

Many of the racial problems shown in sports are present because of the lack of diversity in ownership The predominant presence of white male owners in sports drives a wedge between members of the organization The narrative portrayed by ownership in sports paints the same picture of slave and owner from 400 years ago NBA player Draymond Green ignited debates on the relationship between team ownership and players In 2017 Green stated that the NBA should really consider the term "owner" and its usage dating back to chattel slavery considering the majority of NBA players are black and nearly all team ownership is white This has been a fact virtually the entire history of sports organizations In 1994 Black people accounted for 80% of the NFL players 65% of the NBA players and 18% of the MLB players but less than 10% of team ownership 25 years later the percentage of black athletes and team owners has not changed much with Black people accounting for 70% of the NFL players 81% of the NBA players and 8% of the MLB players Team ownership is still below 10% However one thing that changed with time is the term for ownership in the NBA: NBA commissioner Adam Silver declared in June 2019 that the organization will no longer use the term "owner" and will now refer to owners as governors and partial owners as alternate governors

Aside from a lack of black owners owners make hundreds of times what the players make This is similar to the NFL disparity between owners and the players According to a report by the Green Bay Packers the NFL earned $7808000 from TV deals and split it among its 32 teams evenly This means that each NFL owner "made $244m last year in 2016" The work of the owners is not hundreds of times more valuable than that of the players However it is the power dynamics and politics of the league structure that allow owners to make so much more

Similar to the discrepancy between participation and leadership of blacks in American professional sports leagues NCAA sports also have had a low percentage of administrators and coaches relative to the number of athletes For example during the 2005–2006 academic year high revenue NCAA sports (basketball and football) had 51 percent black student athletes whereas only 17 percent of head coaches in the same high revenue sports were black Also in the same 2005–2006 year only 55 percent of athletic directors at Division I "PWIs" (Primarily White Institutions) were black Terry Bowden a notable white Division I football coach suggests that the reason many university presidents will not hire black coaches is "because they are worried about how alumni and donors will react" a notably higher percentage than of head coaches In terms of administrative positions they have been concentrated largely in the hands of whites As recently as 2009 925 percent of university presidents in the FBS were white 875 percent of athletic directors were white and 100 percent of the conference commissioners were white Despite these statistics black head coaches have become more prevalent at the FBS level As of 2012 there are now 15 black head coaches in FBS football including now 3 in the SEC a conference that did not hire its first black head coach until 2003

 Controversy within The Atlanta Hawks 
The Atlanta Hawks has had multiple cases where racial discrimination has become an issue with the organization In 2012 Bruce Levenson majority ownership holder in the Atlanta Hawks NBA franchise gave an evaluation in an email to other administration on the progress of the Atlanta Hawks game operations In the email Levenson states originally that game operations was not a concern but is now due to the lack of a season ticket base caused by the demographics of attendants at games and those involved with game operations Levenson claims he was told because white males around 35–55 years of age and corporations are not the target of all aspects of game operations season tickets would not sell When pressed for answers no one would not give Levenson any further assistance figuring out the issue It was then he noticed 70% black attendees at games black cheerleaders at the games the music was hiphop customers at the arena bars were 90% black few fathers and sons and the concerts after games were either hiphop or gospel

Despite the email being sent to staff in 2012 it was not revealed until in an investigation of a second incident that included racist remarks in regards to Luol Deng (a British NBA player born in what is now South Sudan) In 2014 Danny Ferry was the President of the Atlanta Hawks franchise In a scouting report on Luol Deng he stated that Deng displayed good traits on the outside but despite seems like a good person hes an African Ferry goes on to compare Deng to "African store front that looks great but theres black market section in the back"

These problematic statements by both Danny Ferry and Bruce Levenson became the driving force behind the sell of the Atlanta HawksThe Atlanta Hawks would be bought for approximately $730 – 850 million by Tony Ressler Due to being overshadowed by a racial incident between Donald Sterling and the Los Angeles Clippers the Hawks organization did not receive much publicity

 Promoting racial harmony and breaking stereotypes 
Racial differences in the NFL are also evident between player positions According to an Undefeated article all positions have remained strongly overrepresented by African American players in the period between 1999 and 2014 with African Americans outnumbering white Americans in several positions However this effect has been less pronounced for the center and quarterback positions: in 1999 the percentage of white players in the center position was 75% compared to 20% for African Americans while the percentage of white players in the quarterback position was 81% compared to 18% for African American; though white Americans outnumbered African Americans in these positions the percentages nonetheless showed significant overrepresentation of African Americans (~13% of the total population of the US) among both center and quarterback players compared to white Americans (~82% of the total population) In 2014 the center position showed more proportionate representation―with 81% being white and 16% African American―while the number of white quarterback players had decreased slightly within the same time frame (coinciding with a 1% increase in black quarterbacks) The study goes on to say that "the terms physical strength and natural ability were more associated with the black quarterbacks while leadership and intelligence was more associated with white quarterbacks" These biases are thought to reflect how football players are viewed by the general populace and ostensibly have an impact on perceptions among adolescents as well

According to William Jeynes a professor of education at California State University Long Beach the gathering at the Thanksgiving (United States)
 Black Women + Bobsledding 
Bobsledding has much representation for Black women At the 2018 Winter Olympics Nigerian and Jamaican bobsled teams debuted The United States Britain Canada and Germany also have Black women compete in bobsledding at the Olympic level The high diversity is somewhat due to bobsledding recruiting athletes from other sports especially track

Black women who have competed in bobsled include: Vonetta Flowers Elana Meyers
 Racial activism in American professional sports 
Racial activism has been found in many of professional sports leagues such as the National Basketball Association and the National Football League

 National Basketball Association 
Following the emergence of the Trayvon Martin case NBA players including LeBron James Dywane Wade Chris Bosh and other Miami Heat players at the time posed for a picture in hoodies the outfit that Trayvon Martin was wearing when killed In December 2014 LeBron James and other Cleveland Cavaliers including Kyrie Irving wore black tshirts featuring the quote "I CANT BREATHE" following the death of Eric Garner who was put in a choke hold by a New York police officer Since then LeBron James has been in public disputes Via Twitter and Instagram shaming Donald Trump and news analyst Laura Ingraham who openly told LeBron James to "shut up and dribble" suggesting that LeBron is only good for his athletic abilities LeBron then went and turned that slogan "Shut up and dribble" into the Title of his Showtime Series that aired in October 2018 The show focuses on athletes who are shifting the narrative of what it means to be a black athlete in the sense that nowadays more and more athletes are speaking up on political and racial topics going on in the United States

 National Football League 


In a 2016 preseason game against the San Diego Chargers Colin Kaepernick a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers chose to kneel instead of standing in solidarity with his teammates for the National Anthem He did this to raise awareness for victims of police brutality and oppression of minorities in America Many people believe Kaepernick is a hero for raising awareness for important social issues However his actions caused a massive backlash by fans and the media who decried him for acting anti American and disrespecting American troops Furthermore players from other teams began to kneel instead of stand with the national anthem When questioned by the media he claimed "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color" He continued "If they take football away my endorsements from me I know that I stood up for what is right"

Kaepernicks act inspired many other players to also kneel during the national anthem Bob McNair owner of the Houston Texans claimed "They cant have the inmates running the prison" during a meeting with owners and no current players After the meeting finished Troy Vincent former cornerback for the Miami Dolphins claimed "In all my years of playing in the NFL I have been called every name in the book including the Nwordbut never felt like an inmate" Many players took to social media to protest the racist rhetoric of Bob McNair Richard Sherman tweeted in response "I can appreciate ppl being candid Dont apologize! You meant what you said Showing true colors allows ppl to see you for who you are" Damon Harrison Sr tweeted "Did that wake some of yall up now?"

Kaepernick claimed to be blackballed by all 32 teams following being released for his on the field protest in support of the Black Lives Matter
 Issues in sports commentating 
Racial remarks have been made about athletes of color throughout history Radio host Don Imus described the Rutgers University womens basketball team as "nappyheaded hos" on his radio program "Imus in the Morning" in 2007 Later on he proclaimed that the matchup between Rutgers and their opponents looked like a showdown of the "jigaboos versus the wannabes"

In 1988 sports commentator Jimmy Snyder (sports commentator)
Snyder would later express regret for his comments shortly after they aired telling The Washington Post that "I thought I was being instructive when in fact I was destructive"

Snyder was later fired by CBS

Sherman Maxwell was the first African American sports broadcaster He began his career in 1929 on WNJ radio He was known as "the voice of Newark"

 Portrayals in film 
While there are discrepancies in "based on a true story" sports movies the movies are still representing the harsh realities of race and sports well The USset films Hoosiers (film)
Another movie that received critical acclaim was 42 This movie was the Jackie Robinson story a young man who was the first black player in the MLB This movie focused on the journey Robinson took throughout his first year in the major leagues going through the ups and downs There were some moments that critics felt like producers could have given more depth to different characters but overall the film represented that time in America and sports well

Invictus (film)
Some movies about black athletes dont focus completely on the aspect of race The 2001 movie Ali a film about great boxer Muhammed Ali was another story about the journey through his life but only briefly focused on racial aspects There were mentions of some of his career being after the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr but most of the film reflected on Ali and his personal journey that had little to do with the color of his skin In 2022 a film was announced about the 1956 Sugar Bowl which included the first black player to play in a college bowl game in the deep south

 Australia 


Inequality in sport for the Aboriginal Australians exists due to material barriers A 2007 report by the Australian Human Rights Commission suggested that fear of "racial vilification" was partly responsible for the underrepresentation of Aboriginal and other ethnic groups in Australian sports

In the recent years the influence of Polynesians
At the elite level of the game Aboriginal Australians represented 35% of the roster for the Kangaroos 21% of players at the 2012 State of Origin series 12% of NRL players and a further 8% of the NRL Under20s players By way of comparison 23% of the Australian population identified themselves as Indigenous in the 2006 Australian census

 South Africa 
In South Africa black representation on the cricket and rugby national sports teams is ensured via the introduction of quotas

 United States 
Discussions of race and sports in the United States where the two subjects have always been intertwined in American history have focused to a great extent on African Americans Depending on the type of sport and performance level African Americans are reported to be over or underrepresented

In 2013 while 28% of fulltime degreepursuing undergraduates were black men the group comprised 57% of college football teams and 64% of mens basketball players according to Shaun R Harper While blacks predominate in football and basketball whites predominate in all other regulated sports

A 2001 study indicated that black high school students play harder than white students because the former were more likely to perceive sports as a venue to success The study denies that racial characteristics per se are a factor in success in sports Despite such evidence pseudoscientific conceptions of race continue to play a role in the way many in the United States understand AfricanAmerican contributions to sports


For all races and sports from 33% (basketball) to 113% (ice hockey) are successful in making the transition from high school varsity to an NCAA team From 8% (mens ice hockey) to 94% (baseball) successfully transition from NCAA to professional teams Therefore the overall success rate of high school athletes progressing to professional athletes was from 03% (men and womens basketball) to 5% (baseball)<!presume that baseball includes AAA minor leagues> The annual number of NCAA athletes drafted into professional sports annually varied from seven (mens ice hockey) to 678 (baseball)

Unlike black athletes blacks as a group have not perceived sports as an important venue to prosperity
There are higher participation rates by blacks as well as higher numbers of people in nonathletic endeavor such as policy teaching physicians lawyers engineers and architects

Athletics have been increasingly subsidized by tuition Only one in eight of the 202 NCAA Division I
