In the philosophy of mind the China brain thought experiment (also known as the Chinese Nation or Chinese Gym) considers what would happen if each member of the China

The Chinese room scenario analyzed by John Searle<ref name"Searle1980">cite journal
          </ref> is a similar thought experiment in philosophy of mind that relates to artificial intelligence Instead of people each modeling a single neuron of the brain in the Chinese room clerks who do not speak Chinese accept notes in Chinese and return an answer in Chinese according to a set of rules without the people in the room ever understanding what those notes mean In fact the original short story Anatoly_Dneprov_(writer)The_Game
Background
Many theories of mental states are materialism
The thought experiment
Suppose that the whole nation of China were reordered to simulate the workings of a single brain (that is to act as a mind according to functionalism) Each Chinese person acts as (say) a neuron and communicates by special twoway radio in corresponding way to the other people The current mental state of the China brain is displayed on satellites that may be seen from anywhere in China The China brain would then be connected via radio to a body one that provides the sensory inputs and behavioral outputs of the China brain

Thus the China brain possesses all the elements of a functional description of mind: sensory inputs behavioral outputs and internal mental states causally connected to other mental states If the nation of China can be made to act in this way then according to functionalism this system would have a mind Blocks goal is to show how Intuition (knowledge)
Consciousness
The China brain argues that consciousness is a problem for functionalism Blocks Chinese nation presents a version of what is known as the absent qualia objection to functionalism because it purports to show that it is possible for something to be functionally equivalent to a human being and yet have no conscious experience A creature that functions like a human being but doesnt feel anything is known as a "philosophical zombie" So the absent qualia objection to functionalism could also be called the "zombie objection"

Criticisms
Some philosophers like Daniel Dennett have concluded that the China brain does create a mental state Functionalist philosophers of mind endorse the idea that something like the China brain can realise a mind and that neurons are in principle not the only material that can create a mental state<ref name"Feser2006">cite book
