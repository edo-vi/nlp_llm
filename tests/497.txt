Background
Tyson and Holyfield had Mike Tyson vs Evander Holyfield
When the fight was signed Halpern was again assigned to be the referee Tysons management objected with the official reason being that they wanted a different referee for the rematch It was believed though never confirmed that the actual reason why Tyson and crew objected to Halperns assignment was that Holyfield had clashed heads with Tyson several times during the course of the first fight and Halpern ruled them all accidental The Nevada State Athletic Commission ruled against the Tyson camp but Halpern willingly withdrew from the fight days before because he felt his presence would be a distraction The assignment was instead given to the veteran Lane who had worked six previous fights featuring Tyson and seven featuring Holyfield

Match

The match began with Holyfield dominating Tyson Holyfield won the first three rounds At 2:19 of the first round an overhand right punch from Holyfield stunned Tyson but Tyson fought back immediately pushing Holyfield backwards At 32 seconds into the second round Holyfield ducked under a right punch from Tyson In doing so he headbutted Tyson producing a large cut over the latters right eye (although trainer Ritchie Giachetti believed the injury happened in the first round) Tyson had repeatedly complained about headbutting in the first bout between the two fighters Upon reviewing replays referee Mills Lane stated that the headbutts were unintentional and nonpunishable

Holyfield leapt into the air in pain and spun in a circle bleeding profusely from the bite wound Lane stopped the action but Tyson managed to rush Holyfield from behind and shove him into his corner Lane separated the men moved Tyson to a neutral corner and went back to check on an enraged Holyfield The fight would be delayed for the next few minutes as Lane decided on what to do 

Lane called Marc Ratner the chairman of Nevada’s athletic commission up
to the ring apron and informed him that because Tyson had bitten Holyfield’s ear he was going to disqualify him and end the fight Meanwhile ringside physician Flip Homansky was performing his own check on the champion and Lane decided to defer to him Once Homansky cleared Holyfield to continue the fight Lane decided to allow the bout to continue but not before penalizing Tyson with a twopoint deduction for the bite As Lane explained the decision to Tyson and his cornermen Tyson asserted that the injury to Holyfields ear was the result of a punch "Bullshit" Lane retorted

During another clinch Tyson bit Holyfields left ear Holyfield threw his hands around to escape the clinch and jumped back Tysons second bite just scarred Holyfields ear At the time of the second bite Lane did not stop the match and both combatants continued fighting until time expired The men walked back to their respective corners and when the second bite was discovered the match was halted again

Postfight unrest
After the match was stopped Tyson went on a rampage at Holyfield and his trainer Brooks while they were still in their corner Lane told Tysons corner that he was disqualifying Tyson for biting Holyfield To protect Holyfield security surrounded him in his corner and Tyson was taken back to his corner by security Lane was interviewed and said that the bites were intentional He had told Tyson not to bite anymore and said Tyson asked to be disqualified by disobeying that order Holyfield left the ring seconds after the interview which gave the fans and audience the hint that the match was over Holyfield told the press afterward that Tyson bit him because he knew he was going to get knocked out and he chose to lose in a disqualification instead

Reporters then interviewed Tysons instructor who was upset about Lanes decision The instructor said "They will have to explain that I do not agree with it but it is what it is&nbsp; all I know is Mike Tyson has a cut in his eye"

Twentyfive minutes after the brawl ended announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr read the decision: "Ladies and gentlemen this bout has been stopped at the end of round number three The referee in charge Mills Lane disqualifies Mike Tyson for biting Evander Holyfield in both ears the winner by way of disqualification and still the WBA Champion of the world Evander the Real Deal Holyfield!" As a result Holyfield remained the WBA Heavyweight champion

Tyson later remarked that his bites were in retaliation for the headbutts from Holyfield

Later during postmatch interviews Tyson was walking back to his locker room when a fan from the venue tossed a bottle of water in his direction Tyson his instructor and a pain manager climbed over a temporary railing and up into the stands made obscene gestures to the crowd and made their way up the side of a stairway Tyson had to be restrained as he was led off When interviewed about his championship and the incident with Mike Tyson Holyfield said he already forgave Tyson for biting him

The commentators for the Sky Sports broadcast of the bout Ian Darke and Glenn McCrory noted that no one had been disqualified in a title bout for more than 50 years correctly estimating that the last disqualification was during a bout between Joe Louis and Buddy Baer in 1941 where Baer was disqualified after his cornermen refused to leave the ring in protest of what they believed was a late hit They also compared the match to The Long Count Fight and the Muhammad Ali versus Sonny ListonThe phantom/anchor punch
