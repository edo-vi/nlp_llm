Fencing career
2013–19
Though Hadzic was banned from representing Columbia University he wasn’t banned from fencing at large His club was the Fencers Club in New York City with Alexey Cheremsky as his coach

In October 2013 the lawyer for the woman who was the victim in Hadzics 2013 Title IX case urged USA Fencing to bar Hadzic from competitions noting that Hadzic had been suspended from his university after an investigation into an accusation that he had sexually assaulted a woman Both the victim and Hadzic were USA Fencing members  But USA Fencing CEO Kris Ekeren asserted to the attorney that Hadzic hadn’t violated any of USA Fencings policies inasmuch as Hadzic wasn’t a coach or authority figure and the alleged conduct didn’t take place at a USA Fencing event The woman’s attorney called the decision an "intentional misreading" of USA Fencings own Athlete’s Code of Conduct which prohibited sexually inappropriate behavior between athletes and wrote: <blockquote>A plain reading of this Code of Conduct excerpt renders Mr Hadzic unfit and thus ineligible to participate How can the United States Fencing Association in good conscience claim its hands are tied and permit the participation of a known rapist into its athletic midst?</blockquote> Ekeren never responded to the attorney

In 2015 Hadzic was coaching both boys and girls on the Tappan Zee High School fencing team in  Orangeburg New York That same year a young woman said Hadzic groped her

2020–21
In June 2021 the US Center for SafeSport temporarily suspended Hadzic from any fencing activities after three women accused him of committing sexual misconduct against them and at least 10 witnesses submitted statements supporting the claimants allegations But later that month an arbitrator who reviewed the suspension without hearing from any of Hadzics accusers though she left in place a directive for Hadzic not to contact his accusers lifted the temporary suspension until his investigation was complete  She did so opining that if Hadzic were to participate on the Olympic team in her view it would not be “detrimental to the reputation of the United States or his sport” 

With his temporary suspension lifted for the moment in the summer of 2021 he traveled to the 2020 Summer Olympics
Hadzic unsuccessfully appealed USA Fencings safety plan as an independent arbitrator ruled against him

After the Olympics USA Fencing was heavily criticized by athletes and parents about the Hadzic debacle In a call between USA Fencing’s executives and board members about the Hadzic matter atlarge director David Alperstein waved off concerns saying: "This will all blow over"

In October 2021 USA Fencing blocked Hadzic from entering any competitions "for the foreseeable future  except to the extent it is legally compelled to do so"

2022–present
By July 2022 at least six women had filed claims of sexual misconduct including rape against Hadzic with SafeSport At least one said Hadzic had sex with her when she was a minor in high school despite her repeatedly saying no That month SafeSport put in place safeguards that USA Fencing itself had already established a year prior to protect people in the fencing community requiring Hadzic to not communicate in any way with what were now six victims to not stay in the same hotel or housing as "any female athletes or coaches of the US delegation" and requiring him to have a chaperone when at fencing competitions

In 2022/2023 he was ranked 273rd in the world in mens epee

In June 2023 after an investigation of over two years due to his sexual misconduct Hadzic was permanently banned by SafeSport which also imposed nocontact directives upon him His ban prohibits him from participating "in any capacity in any event program activity or competition authorized by organized by or under the auspices of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) the national governing body
