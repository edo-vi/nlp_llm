Braxy is an infectious disease which causes sudden death in sheep It is caused by the bacterium Clostridium septicum

Braxy generally occurs in winter when sheep eat frosted root crops The frozen feed damages the mucosa (lining) of the abomasum allowing C&nbsp;septicum to enter causing abomasitis and a fatal bacteremia

Young sheep not protected with a vaccine are most commonly affected If sheep are not found dead signs include abdominal pain and recumbency The carcass of sheep which died of braxy will often decompose more rapidly than expected

Historically the mutton of affected sheep was also referred to as braxy

A vaccine against braxy was developed at the Moredun Research Institute in Scotland

Braxy has been reported in Europe (particularly in Iceland Norway and the UK) Australia and the United States
