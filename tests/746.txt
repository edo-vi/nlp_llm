Immunization during pregnancy is the administration of a vaccine to a pregnancy
Other vaccines may be offered during pregnancy where travelrelated or occupational exposure to diseasecausing organisms warrant this However certain vaccines are contraindicated in pregnancy These include vaccines that include attenuated vaccine
Tetanus and whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy
Newborns are at increased risk of infection particularly before they receive their first infant vaccinations For this reason certain vaccinations are offered during pregnancy in order to induce an antibody response resulting in the passage of antibody across the placenta and into the fetus: this confers passive immunity on the newborn As early as 1879 it was noted that infants born following smallpox vaccination in pregnancy were themselves protected against smallpox However the original smallpox vaccination was never widely used during pregnancy because as a live vaccine its use is contraindicated

Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani Neonatal tetanus
Whooping cough or pertussis is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis It is fatal in an estimated 05% of infants in the USA The first vaccine against whooping cough was developed in the 1930s and in the 1940s a study found that vaccination in pregnancy protected infants against developing whooping cough

The tetanus and whooping cough vaccinations are generally administered in combination during pregnancy for example as the DTaP vaccine (which also protects against diphtheria) or the 4in1 vaccine (which also protects against diphtheria and polio)

Influenza vaccination in pregnancy
Influenza is a respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses Pregnant women are disproportionately affected by influenza: in the 1918 pandemic mortality rates as high as 27% were reported in this population and in the 1957 pandemic nearly 20% of deaths in pregnancy were attributed to influenza In the 2009 pandemic even with medical advances pregnant women accounted for a disproportionately high percentage of deaths

The influenza vaccine was first used in the US military from 1938 and then in the civilian population from the 1940s Given the increased risk of influenza during pregnancy public health bodies in the USA recommended that pregnant women should be prioritised for influenza vaccination from the 1960s with the CDC endorsing the recommendation from 1997 However it was not until 2005 that a randomised clinical trial formally demonstrated the efficacy of influenza vaccination in pregnancy

Following the 2009 pandemic both Australia and the UK added influenza vaccination to the recommended schedule for pregnant women

COVID19 vaccination in pregnancy

COVID19 is a respiratory infection caused by the SARSCoV2 virus Before COVID19 vaccines were available pregnant women who caught the disease were at increased risk of needing intensive care invasive ventilation or ECMO but not at increased risk of death Infection significantly increased the risk of preterm birth stillbirth and preeclampsia<ref>cite journal 
COVID19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe and associated with improved levels of risk for stillbirth premature birth and admission of the newborn to intensive care Vaccination can prevent COVID19 infection during pregnancy although these immunity benefits are not passed on to the child

mRNA COVID19 vaccines were first rolled out in December 2020 At this time in recognition of the risks posed by COVID19 disease in pregnancy the US and Israel offered the vaccines to all pregnant women shortly afterwards and the first safety and effectiveness data therefore came from these vaccines and these nations

Rubella vaccination to prevent fetal disease
Rubella or German measles is an infection caused by the rubella virus In childhood it usually causes a mild disease but infection in pregnancy can result in fetal infection or congenital rubella syndrome which causes neonatal deaths deafness blindness and intellectual disabilities The first rubella vaccine was licensed for use in 1969 with its development largely spurred by the heavy burden of congenital rubella experienced in the 1960s

Because the rubella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine there is a theoretical risk that it could cause fetal infection although this has never been seen to occur Therefore rubella vaccination is usually avoided during pregnancy Rather vaccination is offered to children to reduce the prevalence of rubella virus in circulation and/or to adolescent girls to boost their immunity before they are likely to conceive
