File:Codex Aureus Sankt EmmeramjpgThe Early Middle Ages (or early medieval period) sometimes controversially referred to as the Dark Ages (historiography)
The period saw a continuation of trends evident since late classical antiquity including population decline especially in urban centres a decline of trade Medieval Warm Period
Many of the listed trends reversed later in the period In 800 the title of Emperor was revived in Western Europe with Charlemagne whose Carolingian Empire greatly affected later European social structure and history Europe experienced a return to systematic agriculture in the form of the feudal system which adopted such innovations as Threefield system

History

Collapse of Rome


Starting in the 2nd century various indicators of Roman civilization began to decline including urbanization seaborne commerce and population Archaeologists have identified only 40 percent as many Mediterranean Sea
File:20080517SuttonHoojpg
Early in the 3rd century Germanic peoples migrated south from Scandinavia and reached the Black Sea creating formidable confederations which opposed the local Sarmatians In Dacia (presentday Romania) and on the steppes north of the Black Sea the Goths a Germanic people established at least two kingdoms: Thervings
The arrival of the Huns in 372–375 ended the history of these kingdoms The Huns a confederation of central Asian tribes founded an empire They had mastered the difficult art of shooting composite Recurve bow
The discipline and organization of a Roman legion made it a superb fighting unit The Romans preferred infantry to cavalry because infantry could be trained to retain the formation in combat while cavalry tended to scatter when faced with opposition While a barbarian army could be raised and inspired by the promise of plunder the legions required a central government and taxation to pay for salaries constant training equipment and food The decline in agricultural and economic activity reduced the empires taxable income and thus its ability to maintain a professional army to defend itself from external threats

In the Gothic War (376–382) the Goths revolted and confronted the Late Roman army
The empire lacked the resources and perhaps the will to reconstruct the professional mobile army destroyed at Adrianople so it had to rely on barbarian armies to fight for it The Eastern Roman Empire succeeded in buying off the Goths with tribute The Western Roman Empire proved less fortunate Stilicho the western empires halfVandal military commander stripped the Rhine frontier of troops to fend off invasions of Italy by the Visigoths in 402–03 and by other Goths in 406–07

Fleeing before the advance of the Huns the Vandals Suebi and Alans launched an attack across the frozen Rhine near Mainz; on 31 December 406 the frontier gave way and these tribes surged into Roman Gaul There soon followed the Burgundians and bands of the Alamanni In the fit of antibarbarian hysteria which followed the Western Roman Emperor Honorius (emperor)
Migration Period

The Goths and Vandals were only the first of many bands of peoples that flooded Western Europe in the absence of administrative governance Some lived only for war and pillage and disdained Roman ways Other peoples had been in prolonged contact with the Roman civilization and were to a certain degree romanized "A poor Roman plays the Goth a rich Goth the Roman" said King Theoderic the Great
During the migrations or Völkerwanderung (wandering of the peoples) the earlier settled populations were sometimes left intact though usually partially or entirely displaced Culture of ancient Rome
File:Trésor de Gourdon 02JPG
The pax Romana had provided safe conditions for trade and manufacture and a unified cultural and educational milieu of farranging connections As this was lost it was replaced by the rule of local potentates sometimes members of the established Romanized ruling elite sometimes new lords of alien culture In Aquitania Gallia Narbonensis southern Italy and Sicily Baetica or southern Spain and the Iberian Mediterranean coast Roman culture lasted until the 6th or 7th centuries

The gradual breakdown and transformation of economic and social linkages and infrastructure resulted in increasingly localized outlooks This breakdown was often fast and dramatic as it became unsafe to travel or carry goods over any distance; there was a consequent collapse in trade and manufacture for export Major industries that depended on trade such as largescale pottery manufacture vanished almost overnight in places like Britain Tintagel in Cornwall as well as several other centres managed to obtain supplies of Mediterranean luxury goods well into the 6th century but then lost their trading links Administrative educational and military infrastructure quickly vanished and the loss of the established cursus honorum led to the collapse of the schools and to a rise of illiteracy even among the leadership The careers of Cassiodorus (died ) at the beginning of this period and of Alcuin of York (died 804) at its close were founded alike on their valued literacy For the formerly Roman area there was another 20 per cent decline in population between 400 and 600 or a onethird decline for 150–600 In the 8th century the volume of trade reached its lowest level The very small number of shipwrecks found that dated from the 8th century supports this (which represents less than 2 per cent of the number of shipwrecks dated from the 1st century) There was also reforestation and a retreat of agriculture centred around 500

The Romans had practiced Crop rotation
For almost a thousand years Rome was the most politically important richest and largest city in Europe Around 100 AD it had a population of about 450000 and declined to a mere 20000 during the Early Middle Ages reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins and vegetation

The Eastern Roman or "Byzantine" Empire aimed to retain control of the trade routes between Europe and the Orient which made the Empire the richest polity in Medieval Europe Making use of their sophisticated warfare and superior diplomacy the Byzantines managed to fend off assaults by the migrating barbarians Their dreams of subduing the Western potentates briefly materialized during the reign of Justinian I in 527–565 Not only did Justinian restore some western territories to the Roman Empire including Rome and the Italian peninsula itself but he also codified Roman law (with Corpus Juris Civilis

Against this economic background the culture and the imperial traditions of the Eastern Roman Empire attracted its northern neighbours—Slavs Bulgars and Khazars—to Constantinople in search of either pillage or enlightenment The movement of the Germanic tribes to the south triggered the great migration of the Slavs who occupied the vacated territories In the 7th century they moved westward to the Elbe southward to the Danube and eastward to the Dnieper By the 9th century the Slavs had expanded into sparsely inhabited territories to the south and east from these natural frontiers peacefully assimilating the indigenous Illyrians

The Lombards who first entered Italy in 568 under Alboin carved out a state in the north with its capital at Pavia At first they were unable to conquer the Exarchate of Ravenna the Duchy of Rome
The Lombard state was relatively Romanized at least when compared to the Germanic kingdoms in northern Europe It was highly decentralized at first with the territorial dukes having practical sovereignty in their duchies especially in the southern duchies of Duchy of Spoleto
The Lombard state was wellorganized and stabilized by the end of the long reign of Liutprand King of the Lombards
In the south a period of chaos began The Duchy of Benevento maintained its sovereignty in the face of the pretensions of both the Western and Eastern Empires In the 9th century the Muslim conquest of Sicily

The Merovingian dynasty
This increasingly fragmented arrangement was highlighted by Charles Martel who as Mayor of the Palace was effectively the strongest prince in the kingdom His accomplishments were highlighted not just by his famous defeat of invading Muslims at the Battle of Tours which is typically considered the battle that saved Europe from Muslim conquest but by the fact that he greatly expanded Frankish influence It was under his patronage that Saint Boniface
Pepins son Charlemagne continued in the footsteps of his father and grandfather He further expanded and consolidated the Frankish kingdom (now commonly called the Carolingian Empire) His reign also saw a cultural rebirth commonly called the Carolingian Renaissance Though the exact reasons are unclear Charlemagne was crowned "Roman Emperor" by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day 800 Upon Charlemagnes death his empire had united much of modernday France western Germany and northern Italy The years after his death illustrated how Germanic his empire remained Rather than an orderly succession his empire was divided in accordance with Frankish inheritance custom which resulted in instability that plagued his empire until the last king of a united empire Charles the Fat died in 887 which resulted in a permanent split of the empire into West Francia and East Francia West Francia would be ruled by Carolingians until 987 and East Francia until 911 after which time the partition of the empire into France and Germany was complete

Feudalism


Around 800 there was a return to systematic agriculture in the form of the Open field system
Compared to the earlier twofield system a threefield system allowed for significantly more land to be put under cultivation Even more important the system allowed for two harvests a year reducing the risk that a single crop failure will lead to famine Threefield agriculture created a surplus of oats that could be used to feed horses This surplus allowed for the replacement of the ox by the horse after the introduction of the padded horse collar in the 12th century Because the system required a major rearrangement of real estate and of the social order it took until the 11th century before it came into general use The heavy wheeled plough was introduced in the late 10th century It required greater animal power and promoted the use of teams of oxen Illuminated manuscripts depict twowheeled ploughs with both a mouldboard or curved metal ploughshare and a coulter a vertical blade in front of the ploughshare The Romans had used light wheelless ploughs with flat iron shares that often proved unequal to the heavy soils of northern Europe

The return to systemic agriculture coincided with the introduction of a new social system called feudalism This system featured a hierarchy of reciprocal obligations Each man was bound to serve his superior in return for the latters protection This made for confusion of territorial sovereignty since allegiances were subject to change over time and were sometimes mutually contradictory Feudalism allowed the state to provide a degree of public safety despite the continued absence of bureaucracy and written records

Manors became largely selfsufficient and the volume of trade along longdistance routes and in market towns declined during this period though never ceased entirely Roman roads decayed and longdistance trade depended more heavily on water transport

Viking Age

unbulleted list
   

 Viking expansion
The Viking Age spans the period roughly between the late 8th and mid11th centuries in Scandinavia and Great Britain
With the means to travel (longships and open water) desire for goods led Scandinavian traders to explore and develop extensive trading partnerships in new territories Some of the most important trading ports during the period include both existing and ancient cities such as Aarhus Ribe Hedeby Vineta Truso Kaupang Birka Bordeaux Jorvik
Viking raiding expeditions were separate from though coexisted with regular trading expeditions Apart from exploring Europe via its oceans and rivers with the aid of their advanced navigational skills they extended their trading routes across vast parts of the continent They also engaged in warfare looting and enslaving numerous Christian communities of Medieval Europe for centuries contributing to the development of feudal systems in Europe

In 681 the Bulgars founded a powerful and ethnically diverse state that played a defining role in the history of early medieval Southeastern Europe Bulgaria withstood the pressure from Pontic steppe tribes like the Pechenegs Khazars and Cumans and in 806 destroyed the Avars (Carpathians)
After the adoption of Christianity in 864 Bulgaria became a cultural and spiritual hub of the Eastern Orthodox Slavic world The Cyrillic script was developed around 885–886 and was afterwards also introduced with books to Principality of Serbia (early medieval)
Under Simeon I of Bulgariaby a series of successful Byzantine military campaigns Bulgaria was conquered after a long resistance in 1018

Transmission of learning
file:SilosClaustrojpg
With the end of the Western Roman Empire and with urban centres in decline literacy and learning decreased in the West This continued a pattern that had been underway since the 3rd century Much learning under the Roman Empire was in Greek and with the reemergence of the wall between east and west little eastern learning continued in the west Much of the Greek literary corpus remained in Greek and few in the west could speak or read Greek Due to the demographic displacement that accompanied the end of the western Roman Empire by this point most western Europeans were descendants of nonliterate barbarians rather than literate Romans In this sense education was not lost so much as it had yet to be acquired

Education did ultimately continue and was centred in the Monastery
Counterurbanization
Science


In the ancient world Greek was the primary language of science Advanced scientific research and teaching was mainly carried on in the Hellenistic side of the Roman empire and in Greek Late Roman attempts to translate Greek writings into Latin had limited success As the knowledge of Greek declined the Latin West found itself cut off from some of its Greek philosophical and scientific roots For a time Latinspeakers who wanted to learn about science had access to only a couple of books by Boethius (c 470–524) that summarized Greek handbooks by Nicomachus of Gerasa Isidore of Seville produced a Latin encyclopedia in 630 Private libraries would have existed and monasteries would also keep various kinds of texts

The study of nature was pursued more for practical reasons than as an abstract inquiry: the need to care for the sick led to the study of medicine and of ancient texts on drugs; the need for monks to determine the proper time to pray led them to study the motion of the stars; and the need to compute the date of Easter led them to study and teach mathematics and the motions of the Sun and Moon

Carolingian Renaissance

In the late 8th century there was renewed interest in Classical Antiquity as part of the Carolingian Renaissance Charlemagne carried out a reform in education The English monk Alcuin
Institutionally these new schools were either under the responsibility of a monastery (monastic schools) a cathedral or a noble court The teaching of dialectic (a discipline that corresponds to todays logic) was responsible for the increase in the interest in speculative inquiry; from this interest would follow the rise of the Scholasticism
Byzantiums golden age
multiple image

Byzantium under the Macedonians
Byzantiums great intellectual achievement was the Corpus Juris Civilis ("Body of Civil Law") a massive compilation of Roman law made under Justinian (r 528–65) The work includes a section called the Pandects
As for higher education the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens was closed in 526 There was also a school in Alexandria which remained open until the Arab conquest (640) The University of Constantinople founded by Emperor Theodosius II (425) seems to have dissolved around this time It was refounded by Emperor Michael III in 849 Higher education in this period focused on rhetoric although Aristotles logic was covered in simple outline Under the Macedonian dynasty (867–1056) Byzantium enjoyed a golden age and a revival of classical learning There was little original research but many lexicons anthologies encyclopedias and commentaries

Islamic learning
In the course of the 11th century Islams scientific knowledge began to reach Western Europe via Islamic Spain The works of Euclid and Archimedes lost in the West were translated from Arabic to Latin in Spain The modern Hindu–Arabic numeral system including a notation for zero were developed by Hindu mathematicians in the 5th and 6th centuries Muslim mathematicians learned of it in the 7th century and added a notation for decimal fractions in the 9th and 10th centuries Around 1000 Gerbert of Aurillac (later Pope Sylvester II) made an abacus with counters engraved with Arabic numerals A treatise by AlKhwārizmī on how to perform calculations with these numerals was translated into Latin in Spain in the 12th century

Monasteries
Monasteries were targeted in the eighth and ninth centuries by Vikings who invaded the coasts of northern Europe They were targeted not only because they stored books but also precious objects that were looted by invaders In the earliest monasteries there were no special rooms set aside as a library but from the sixth century onwards libraries became an essential aspect of monastic life in Western Europe The Benedictines placed books in the care of a librarian who supervised their use In some monastic reading rooms valuable books would be chained to shelves but there were also lending sections as well Copying was also another important aspect of monastic libraries this was undertaken by resident or visiting monks and took place in the scriptorium In the Byzantine world religious houses rarely maintained their own copying centres Instead they acquired donations from wealthy donors In the tenth century the largest collection in the Byzantine world was found in the monasteries of Mount Athos (modernday Greece) which accumulated over 10000 books Scholars travelled from one monastery to another in search of the texts they wished to study Travelling monks were often given funds to buy books and certain monasteries which held a reputation for intellectual activities welcomed travelling monks who came to copy manuscripts for their own libraries One of these was the monastery of Bobbio in Italy which was founded by the Irish abbot Columbanus in 614 and by the ninth century boasted a catalogue of 666 manuscripts including religious works classical texts histories and mathematical treatises

Christianity West and East


multiple image
Frontispiece of Incipit from the Vatican manuscript

From the early Christians early medieval Christians inherited a church united by major creeds a stable Biblical canon and a welldeveloped philosophical tradition The history of medieval Christianity traces Christianity during the Middle Ages—the period after the fall of the Western Roman Empire until the Reformation
During the early Middle Ages the divide between Eastern and Western Christianity widened paving the way for the EastWest Schism in the 11th century In the West the power of the Bishop of Rome expanded In 607 Boniface III became the first Bishop of Rome to use the title Pope Pope Gregory I used his office as a temporal power expanded Romes missionary efforts to the British Isles and laid the foundations for the expansion of monastic orders Roman church traditions and practices gradually replaced local variants including Celtic Christianity in the British Isles Various barbarian tribes went from raiding and pillaging the island to invading and settling They were entirely pagan having never been part of the Empire though they experienced Christian influence from the surrounding peoples such as those who were converted by the mission of Augustine of Canterbury sent by Pope Gregory I In the East the conquests of Islam reduced the power of the Greekspeaking patriarchates

Christianization of the West


The State church of the Roman Empire
The Germanic Christianity
Europe in 1000

Speculation that the world would end in the year 1000 was confined to a few uneasy French monks Ordinary clerks used regnal years eg the 4th year of the reign of Robert II (the Pious) of France The use of the modern "anno domini" system of dating was largely confined to chroniclers of universal history such as the Venerable Bede

Western Europe remained less developed compared to the Islamic world with its vast network of caravan trade or China at this time the worlds most populous empire under the Song Dynasty Constantinople had a population of about 300000 but Rome had a mere 35000 and Paris 20000 By contrast Córdoba Spain

With nearly the entire nation freshly ravaged by the Vikings England was in a desperate state The longsuffering English later responded with a massacre of Danish settlers in 1002 leading to a round of reprisals and finally to Danish rule (1013) though England regained independence shortly after But Christianization made rapid progress and proved itself the longterm solution to the problem of barbarian raiding The territories of Scandinavia were soon to be fully Christianized Kingdoms: Denmark in the 10th century Norway in the 11th and Sweden the country with the least raiding activity in the 12th Kievan Rus recently converted to Orthodox Christianity flourished as the largest state in Europe Iceland Greenland and Hungary were all declared Christian about 1000

In Europe a formalized institution of marriage was established The proscribed degree of consanguinity varied but the custom made marriages annullable by application to the Pope North of Italy where masonry construction was never extinguished stone construction was replacing timber in important structures Deforestation of the densely wooded continent was under way The 10th century marked a return of urban life with the Italian cities doubling in population London abandoned for many centuries was again Englands main economic centre by 1000 By 1000 Bruges and Ghent held regular trade fairs behind castle walls a tentative return of economic life to western Europe

In the culture of Europe several features surfaced soon after 1000 that mark the end of the Early Middle Ages: the rise of the medieval communes the reawakening of city life and the appearance of the bourgeoisie
In 1000 the papacy was firmly under the control of German Emperor Otto III or "emperor of the world" as he styled himself But later church reforms enhanced its independence and prestige: the Abbey of Cluny

The Early Muslim conquestsFile:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 20151027 135414jpgThe site of the Grand Mosque was originally a pagan temple then a Visigothic Christian church before the Umayyad Moors at first converted the building into a mosque and then built a new mosque on the site

The Transoxiana region was conquered by Qutayba ibn Muslim between 706 and 715 and loosely held by the Umayyads from 715 to 738 This conquest was consolidated by Nasr ibn Sayyar between 738 and 740 It was under the Umayyads from 740 to 748 and under the Abbasids after 748 Sindh attacked in 664 would be subjugated by 712 Sindh became the easternmost province of the Umayyad The Umayyad conquest of Hispania (Visigothic Spain) would begin in 711 and end by 718 The Moors under AlSamh ibn Malik swept up the Iberian peninsula and by 719 overran Septimania; the area would fall under their full control in 720 With the Islamic conquest of Persia the Muslim subjugation of the Caucasus would take place between 711 and 750 The end of the sudden Islamic Caliphate expansion ended around this time The final Islamic dominion eroded the areas of the Iron Age Roman Empire in the Middle East and controlled strategic areas of the Mediterranean

Caliphs and empire


The Abbasid Caliphate ruled by the Abbasid dynasty of caliphs was the third of the Islamic caliphates Under the Abbasids the Islamic Golden Age philosophers scientists and engineers of the Islamic world contributed enormously to technology both by preserving earlier traditions and by adding their own inventions and innovations Scientific and intellectual achievements blossomed in the period

The Abbasids built their capital in Baghdad after replacing the Umayyad caliphs from all but the Iberian peninsula The influence held by Muslim merchants over AfricanArabian and ArabianAsian trade routes was tremendous As a result Islamic civilization grew and expanded on the basis of its merchant economy in contrast to their Christian Indian and Chinese peers who built societies from an agricultural landholding nobility

The Abbasids flourished for two centuries but slowly went into decline with the rise to power of the Turkish army they had created the Mamluks Within 150 years of gaining control of Persia the caliphs were forced to cede power to local dynastic emirs who only nominally acknowledged their authority After the Abbasids lost their military dominance the Samanids (or Samanid Empire) rose up in Central Asia The Sunni Islam empire was a Tajik state and had a Zoroastrian theocratic nobility It was the next native Persian dynasty after the collapse of the Sassanid Persian empire caused by the Arab conquest
