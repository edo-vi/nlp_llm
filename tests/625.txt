The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is an international standard code for uniquely identifying sound recordings and music video recordings The code was developed by the recording industry in conjunction with the International Organization for Standardization
An ISRC identifies a particular recording not the work (composition and lyrical content) itself Therefore different recordings edits and remixes of the same work should each have their own ISRC Works are identified by International Standard Musical Work Code
 History 

ISO 3901 was completed in 1986 In 1988 the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry
The Japanese recording industry began encoding ISRCs on Compact Disc Digital Audio
 Format 
File:ISRC Code Examplejpg
ISRC codes are always 12 characters long in the form "CCXXXYYNNNNN" The hyphens are not part of the ISRC code itself but codes are often presented that way in print to make them easier to read The four parts are as follows:

 "CC" is the appropriate twocharacter country code for the ISRC issuer The code is assigned according to the ISO 3166 "XXX" is a three character alphanumeric registrant code of the ISRC issuer This number by itself does NOT uniquely identify the ISRC issuer as the same 3digit registrant code may be used in various countries for different issuers To uniquely identify an issuer the country code and registrant code should be used together
 "YY" represent the last two digits of the reference year â€“ the year that the ISRC was assigned to the recording This is not necessarily the date the recording was made
 "NNNNN" is a 5digit number that identifies the particular sound or video recording unique within the scope of the reference year

Example:

A recording of the song "Bigger Than Both of Us
 US for United States
 RC1 for RCA Records 76 for 1976
 07839 as the unique id identifying this particular recording

 Embedding ISRC in files 
ISRC may be embedded in most file formats as metadata Example formats include MP3 M4A AAC FLAC and WAV for audio and MP4 or M4V for video
 The standard for the ID3v22 tag that was designed for use in MP3 files was published in March 2019 and defined a way to embed ISRCs in a TSRC frame
 In August 2020 Barry Grint and the European Broadcasting Union published a specification for embedding ISRCs in Broadcast Wave Format a WAVwithmetadata format
 Audio CDs defined by the Compact Disc Digital Audio
Metadata formats are not generally interchangeable as format converters may fail to translate the data As a result it is recommended to perform the embedding separately for each format

Obtaining ISRCs
The provision of ISRCs is overseen by appointed http://isrcifpiorg/contact/nationalagencycontactsA national ISRC agencies These national ISRC agencies issue codes directly to the public and may also utilize authorized ISRC Managers to issue ISRCs In the United States the appointed agency is RIAA ISRC codes can be obtained in large blocks directly from RIAA for an administrative fee ($95 at time of this publication) in quantities as little as 1 from https://wwwISRCcomA ISRCcom ($2$5) or in conjunction with other musicrelated services from other authorized ISRC managers  In territories where there is no national ISRC agency users can obtain ISRC codes directly from IFPI or from https://wwwISRCcomA ISRCcom https://wwwquansiccomA Quansic and music information management and file transfer platforms like https://wwwsoundcreditcomA Sound Credit
