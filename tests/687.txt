 Collapse 
The 7th century was a watershed in the history of the Byzantine Empire At its beginning the Eastern Roman Empire still controlled most of the Mediterranean basins shores and faced the Sassanid Persian empire as its main eastern rival The Fall of the Western Roman Empire had eroded this traditional order and despite Emperor Justinian Is wars of reconquest in the 6th century many of his gains in Italy and Spain were quickly undone But it was still recognizably the late antique world dominated by the Roman Empire with the Mediterranean mare nostrum as its center of gravity and cities as the main social and economic unit 

The Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628
 Transformation 
This crisis led to a profound transformation in the nature and culture of the Byzantine state that was not completed until the 9th century when the Muslim pressure on the Empire slackened The Byzantine state that emerged "was an empire and culture focused on emperor and capital" It was also much more militarized: The civilian lateantiquity administrative structure put in place by Diocletian and his successors was replaced by the Theme (Byzantine district)
The Muslim conquests coupled with the Slavic migrations to the Balkans
Education suffered a severe blow during this period Some form of higher education was still available in the capital; albeit there too few figures of prominence are known and private education was still available for the wealthy but acquiring it was much more difficult In particular education in Roman law which had been the basis for a public career suffered an abrupt decline aided by the fact that legal teaching had traditionally been in the hands of a small group of mostly pagan professors The numerical and qualitative decline of the educated classes had as a result the decline in the number of philological works produced as the remaining audience for such works was small and diminishing with every passing year Art and architecture followed suit with many quarries being abandoned Apart from fortifications —often quite hastily executed — almost all building activity ceased during this period

 Historical sources 
Examining this crucial period in Byzantine history has posed many difficulties to modern scholars as the Byzantine historical sources about it are few and mostly originated later than the period itself No Byzantine historical source is known from the end of the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628
