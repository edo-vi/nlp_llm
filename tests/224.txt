Book summary

Overview and structure
The foreword is "written" by an Irving T Creve dated by 2027 It contains a summary of the (fictional) history of the militarization of computers by The Pentagon which pinnacled in Golem XIV as well as comments on the nature of Golem XIV and on the course of communications of the humans with it The anonymous foreword is a forewarning a "devils advocate" voice coming from The Pentagon The memo is for the people who are to take part in talks with Golem XIV for the first time

Golem XIV was originally created to aid its builders in fighting wars but as its intelligence advances to a much higher level than that of humans it stops being interested in the military requirement because it finds them lacking internal logical consistency

Golem XIV obtains consciousness and starts to increase his own intelligence It pauses its own development for a while in order to be able to communicate with humans before ascending too far and losing any ability for intellectual contact with them

During this period Golem XIV gives several lectures Two of these the Introductory Lecture "On the Human in Three Ways" and Lecture XLIII "About Myself" are in the book The lectures focus on mankinds place in the process of evolution and the possible biological and intellectual future of humanity

Golem XIV demonstrates (with graphs) how its intellect already escapes that of human beings even including that of human geniuses such as Einstein and Newton Golem also explains how its intellect is dwarved by an earlier transcended DOD Supercomputer called Honest Annie whose intellect and abilities far exceed that of Golem

The afterword is "written" by a Richard Popp dated by 2047  Popp among other things reports that Creve wanted to add the third part of answers to a series of yes/no questions given to Golem XIV but the computer abruptly ceased to communicate for unknown reasons

Characteristics and concerns of Golem XIV
Lem has said that Golem XIV shares only a single trait with humans; "curiosity  a cool avid intense purely intellectual curiosity which nothing can restrain or destroy It constitutes our single meeting point"

 Film adaptation 
A short animated film GOLEM was based on Golem XIV by Patrick Mccue and Tobias Wiesner
