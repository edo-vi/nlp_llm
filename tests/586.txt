Sports teams named Redskins are part of the larger Native American mascot controversy
The most prominent team of this name was the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) which had been at the center of Washington Redskins name controversy
The college sports teams using the name changed voluntarily prior to the NCAA Native American mascot decision in 2005; the University of Utah became Utah Utes in 1972 Miami University
The South Eastern Manitoba Hockey League team that was formerly the Morden Redskins was renamed Morden Bombers in 2020

Several high schools have followed the example of the Washington NFL team and agreed to change their names Other high school and youth teams continue to use the name though the number has been steadily declining Defenders of the Redskins name both nationally and locally cite their tradition and the pride they feel in their team while calls for change are often dismissed as political correctness The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) database tracks 89 K12 schools in 40 school districts with the Redskins mascot

 Mascot controversy 

In the early 20th century sports teams began adopting Native Americanthemed names including "Redskins" Miami University in Ohio and Huntley High School in Huntley Illinois started using the "Redskins" name in 1928 In 1933 the Boston Braves of the National Football League changed their name to the Boston Redskins; the team states that this was done in honor of Native Americans on the team although owner George Preston Marshall said at the time it was done to avoid confusion with the Boston Braves (baseball)
Native American mascots are often discussed in the media in terms of offensiveness which reduces it to feelings and opinions and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated Social science research says that sports mascots and images rather than being mere entertainment are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects Stereotyping may directly affect the academic performance and selfesteem of Native American youth whose people face high rates of suicide unemployment and poverty EuroAmericans exposed to mascots may be more likely to believe not only that such stereotypes are true but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes Research demonstrates the harm of stereotyping with studies showing that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking with regard to other groups

In 2005 the American Psychological Association issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots Symbols Images and Personalities by Schools Colleges Universities Athletic Teams and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment the negative impact on the selfesteem of American Indian children and discrimination that may violate civil rights It also impacts nonnatives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes preventing learning about Native American culture The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs traditions and values of Native Americans Similar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport the American Sociological Association the American Counseling Association and the American Anthropological Association In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students the National Education Association included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as one of its recommendations

Washington Redskins

Native American individuals tribes and organizations have been questioning the use of the name and image for decades In the 1940s the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media Over time the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports The NCAI maintains that teams with Indian mascots Defamation
In response to the controversy the team owner Dan Snyder sent an open letter to fans that was published in The Washington Post in October 2013 In the letter Snyder states that the most important meaning of the name Redskins is the association that fans have to memories of their personal history with the team Snyder also states that the name was chosen in 1933 to honor Native Americans in general and the coach and four players at that time who were Native American; and that in 1971 the then coach George Allen consulted with the Red Cloud Athletic Fund on the Pine Ridge reservation when designing the logo

High schools
The number of high schools using the Redskins name has been in steady decline 40% having had local efforts to change the name Between 1988 and April 2013 28 high schools in 18 states had done so By December 2017 the number of high school "Redskins" had continued to decline from 62 to 49 including four affected by a 2015 California law In July 2019 the number became 48 with retirement of the nickname at Teton High School Paw Paw High School (Michigan)
Two schools in immediate response to the Washington Redskins name change also made that decision: Anderson High School in Ohio and Clinton Community Schools in Michigan Union High School (Tulsa Oklahoma)
On its official website in early 2013 the Washington Redskins posted articles referring to high school teams using the same name (and often the same logo) The athletic director of Coshocton High School in Coshocton Ohio is quoted as saying "We are very proud of our athletic teams and very proud to be called Redskins!" The principal of McLoud High School in McLoud Oklahoma says that not only students but the local Native American population take pride in the name The coach at Lamar High School (Houston Texas)
Advocates for the Washington team often refer to the three majority Native American schools concluding that because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves it is not insulting However the principal of one of these Red Mesa High School in Teec Nos Pos Arizona said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created" Wellpinit High School on the Spokane people

Opposition to change
Neshaminy High School Pennsylvania

In 2013 after failing in her appeals directly to Neshaminy High School a parent Donna FannBoyle (CherokeeChoctaw) filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) alleging the "Redskins" name is a form of harassment offensive to Native Americans and her then 13yearold son who attended the school The school board unanimously voted to ask the commission to dismiss the complaint

In 2015 the PHRC made a preliminary finding that the name Redskins is "racially derogatory" and creates a "hostile educational environment" On November 25 2019 the PHRC issued a final order "that the school cease and desist from the use of any and all logos and imagery in the Neshaminy High School that negatively stereotype Native Americans; and that at this time the use of the term Redskins shall be permitted so long as the requisite educational information is provided to District students to ensure that students do not form the idea that it is acceptable to stereotype any group; the District shall  also develop an appropriate educational experience consistent with the points outlined in the opinion; within 30 days of the effective date of this order the that the District shall report to the PHRC on the manner of its compliance with the terms of the order; additionally as long as the District continues to use the name Redskins the district shall report on the actions it has taken to comply with the educational requirements of this order" The board of the Neshaminy School District voted unanimously in 2019 to appeal the entire PHRC decision their attorney saying that the claims of racism are untrue and that Neshaminy is being singled out for unfair treatment compared to the other Pennsylvania schools that also use Native American names or imagery In the six years of litigation (20132019) the school district spent about $435000 to defend the team name and images In 2021 the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania reversed the PHRCs final order on the basis of failure to establish discrimination against Native Americans

School newspaper
After hearing FannBoyles and other Native Americans editors of the student newspaper the Neshaminy High SchoolPlaywickian
The principal and the school board president decided that the student newspapers editorial board did not have the right to refuse to use the name The school board reached a compromise policy in which the name would not be entirely banned but allowed in editorials and letters to the editor; however the editors of the paper and their attorney maintain that this policy is contrary to state law and the United States Constitution
The Playwickian refusal to print the name came to a head when a student in favor of remaining Redskins submitted an editorial which the paper printed with the name redacted The principal eventually suspended the papers faculty adviser Tara Huber for two days and suspended editorinchief from her duties The papers funding was also cut by the approximate cost of the redacted issue The faculty adviser Tara Huber was named Journalism Teacher of the Year in 2014 by the Pennsylvania School Press Association The Playwickian journalists were honored by the American Civil Liberties Union
The law firm representing the Student Press Law Center has sent a https://s3amazonawscom/mediaspl/1307_letter_to_torrente_00953941xb68baopdf letter to the solicitor of the Neshaminy School District citing the federal and state laws and school policy that have been violated by the school administration in failing to respect the independence decision of the Playwickian editorial board to redact the Redskins name in all articles submitted
