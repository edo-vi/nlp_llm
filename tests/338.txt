Tidal scour is "seafloor erosion caused by strong tidal currents resulting in the removal of inshore sediments and formation of deep holes and channels" Examples of this hydrological process can be found globally  Two locations in the United States where tidal scour is the predominant shaping force is the San Francisco Bay and the Elkhorn Slough Tidal force can also contribute to bridge scour

 Historical Perspective and Relevance 
Research on tidal scour is largely centered at Elkhorn Slough in California The slough was directly exposed to tidal flux beginning in 1947 with the creation of the Moss Landing CaliforniaFile:Moss Landing California aerial viewjpg
 Formation 
Tidal scours are formed in tidedominated River delta
 Anatomy 

 Bathymetry 
Tidal scour can be determined by looking at the change in bathymetry over time Bathymetry of tidal channels is determined using Sonar
 Grain Size Distribution 
Sediment grab samples show that in areas demonstrating tidal scour there is an increase in grain size from surrounding areas

 Ecological Significance 
With direct influence from the Ocean slough GeomorphologyIncreased transport of agricultural runoff such as DDTladen sediment introduced by increased tidal scour
The erosion of marshes and eelgrass beds
The loss of Benthos
