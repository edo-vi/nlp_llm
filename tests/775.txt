 Freud and psychoanalysis 



Freud first introduced the concept of identification in his 1921 book Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego where he referred to it as “the original form of emotional tie with an object” He initially detected the occurrence of identification whilst analysising his patients dreams for therapeutic purposes In his later works he isolated three separate modes of identification: primary identification hysterical identification and narcissistic identification

In Freudian psychoanalysis identification is largely considered a process "in which something previously experienced as external becomes internal" Primary identification however is defined by psychoanalysts as a "state" of experienced oneness with the object where the distinction between the self and nonself is suspended

Psychoanalytic literary criticism is a method of reading and analysing texts through the lens of Psychoanalytic theory
Identification is a key concept in psychoanalytic literary criticism Drawing upon the large body of psychoanalytic theory Merav Roth identified seven forms of identification which can occur whilst reading literature Among these are; internalised identification where parts of a character are internalised to become parts of the reader internalised identification with ‘good’ objects or characters is part of the pleasure of reading and can repair the individuals sense of internal goodness; projective identification where an individual projects an aspect of themselves onto an object used to distance oneself from anxiety readers can project traits onto a character in order to work through them; and intrusive identification whereby a character penetrates the psyche of the reader momentarily suspending the reader within the narrative as an extreme form of empathy

 In archetypal literary criticism

Archetypal literary criticism is a critical framework for literary analysis which draws on the principles of analytical psychology by interpreting texts through the lens of recurring myths and archetypes In archetypal criticism identification occurs between the reader and the archetype which a character is modelled from either knowingly or unknowingly by the author

Northrop Frye was considered to be one of the most influential literary critics of the 20th century and a pioneering figure of archetypal criticism after Jung

Alfred Hitchcock was an English New Wave cinema
One way in which Hitchcock established viewer identification in his films was through camera work By using restrained acting during facial closeups and during shot/reverse shot sequences Hitchcock designed his scenes in such a way that when the camera cut to what the character was looking at "the viewer would experience the emotion directly through identification rather than by observing the actors artifice of sentiment"

Hitchcock subverted traditional Hollywood films by inciting viewer identification with flawed characters Critics have argued that this is due to Hitchcocks exploitation of viewer identification The audience identifies and sympathises with Marion the female lead up until the point of her brutal murder in the shower by Norman Bates in which according to critic Robin Wood (critic)
