 Proprietary and obsolete file formats 
The problem is not limited to text documents but applies equally to photos video audio and other kinds of electronic documents One concern leading to the use of the term is that documents are stored on physical Digital media
The digital dark age also applies to the problems which arise due to Digital preservationMigration
 Archiving the internet 
The Internet Archive has stated that one of their goals is to prevent the digital dark age

Vinton Cerf Vice President of Google showed his concerns about data preservation in the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2015: "As the way that we store information about ourselves develops memories stored in files that use older technology are becoming harder to access That could mean that historians of the future are unable to learn about our lives" His suggested solution consists of preserving a sample of every piece of software and hardware that has ever existed so that it never becomes obsolete He proposed taking an Xray snapshot of the content the application and the operating system along with a description of the machine This information should be then stored instead of in a museum in servers in the cloud

 Historical examples 
A famous example is NASA whose early space records have suffered from a dark age issue more than once For over a decade magnetic tapes from the 1976 Viking program         
Another example is the BBC Domesday Project in which a survey of the nation was compiled 900 years after the Domesday Book was published While the original Domesday Book of 1086 is still readable today there were great fears that the discs of the 1986 Domesday Project would become unreadable as software and disk drives capable of reading the format became rarer and rarer However in 2002 the BBC_Domesday_ProjectCAMiLEON          
 Encryption and data preservation 
Encryption may exacerbate the problem of preserving data since decoding adds complexity even when the relevant software is available<ref>cite web
          </ref> Historically encrypted data is quite rare but even the very simple means available throughout history have provided many examples of documents that can only be read with great effort For example it took the capacity of a distributed computing project to break the mechanically generated code of a single brief World War II submarine tactical message<ref>cite news
          </ref>

Open source file formats
As more records are stored in digital form there have been several measures to standardize electronic file formats so software to read them is widely available and can be reimplemented on new platforms if necessary

PDF/A is an open standard based on Adobe Systems PDF format It has been widely adopted by governments and archives around the world such as the United Kingdom

OpenDocument         
 Data storage standardization 
In 2007 Microsoft created a partnership with the The National Archives (United Kingdom)                    </ref><ref>cite news
         
 Criticism 
The notion of the digital dark age has been criticized by some scholars Some of these such as David Anderson and Jon Tilbury view it as alarmist rhetoric maintaining that the notion of a "dark age" incorrectly states the current condition They argue that there has been significant progress in digital preservation and evidenced in the way organizations continue to find and reuse critical longterm digital information while finding new ways of sharing these with the public Some historians also fault proponents of the digital dark age for historical inaccuracies These include Marilyn Deegan and Simon Tanners claim that the Johannes Gutenberg
