 Concept

 Scope of China (Zhongguo) 


In the English language "Zhongguo ren" (; "People of China") is frequently confused and conflated with "Han ren" (; "Han Chinese
Dynasties of ethnic Han origin only used "Zhongguo" (; "Middle Kingdom") to explicitly refer to Han areas of their empire The Ming dynasty used Zhongguo to refer to only Han areas of the empire excluding areas populated by ethnic minorities under Ming rule from the definition

The Xianbeiled Northern Wei referred to itself as "Zhongguo" and claimed yogurt as a food of Zhongguo Similarly the Jurchen people
In 1271 Kublai Khan proclaimed the Yuan dynasty with the official name "Great Yuan" () and claimed succession from former Chinese dynasties from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors up to the Tang dynasty

List of emperors of the Qing dynasty
The Qing emperors governed frontier nonHan areas in a separate administrative system under the Lifan Yuan Nonetheless it was the Qing emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo and made it "flexible" by using that term to refer to the entire empire Zhongguo was also used by the Qing Empire as an endonym in diplomatic correspondence However some Han subjects criticized their usage of the term and used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria) excluding other frontier areas Han literati who remained loyal to the Ming dynasty held to defining the old Ming borders as "China" and used the term "foreigner" to describe ethnic minorities under Qing rule such as the Mongols as part of their AntiQing sentiment
In an attempt to portray different ethnicities as part of one family ruled by the Qing dynasty the phrase "Zhongwai yijia" (; "interior and exterior as one family") was used to convey the idea of the "unification" of different ethnic groups After conquering China proper the Manchus identified their state as "China" (; ; "Middle Kingdom") and referred to it as "Dulimbai Gurun" in the Manchu language (Dulimbai means "central" or "middle" while gurun means "nation" or "state") The emperors labelled the lands of the Qing Empire (including presentday Manchuria under Qing rule
In the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk the term "China" (Dulimbai Gurun; Zhongguo) was used to refer to the Qing territories in Manchuria in both the Manchu and Chinese language versions of the treaty Additionally the term "the wise Emperor of China" was also used in the Manchu version of the treaty

The Qianlong Emperor rejected the earlier idea that only the Han people could be subjects of China and only Han lands could be considered as part of China Instead he redefined China as being multiethnic saying in 1755 that "there exists a view of China (Zhongxia; ) according to which nonHan peoples cannot become Chinas subjects and their lands cannot be integrated into the territory of China This does not represent our dynastys understanding of China but is instead a view of the earlier Han dynasty
When the Dzungar–Qing Wars
The Yongzheng Emperor spoke out against the claim by antiQing rebels that the Qing dynasty were only the rulers of the Manchus and not of China saying "The seditious rebels claim that we are the rulers of Manchus and only later penetrated central China to become its rulers Their prejudices concerning the division of their and our country have caused many vitriolic falsehoods What these rebels have not understood is the fact that it is for the Manchus the same as the birthplace is for the people of the Zhongyuan
According to Russian scholars SV Dmitriev and SL Kuzmin despite the Qing dynastys usage of the term "China" these empires were known officially by their respective dynastic name NonHan peoples considered themselves as subjects of the Yuan and Qing empires and did not necessarily equate them to "China" This resulted from different ways of the Yuan and Qing legitimization for different peoples in these empires Qing emperors were referred to as "Khagan of China" (or "KhaganChinese khagans
The modern territorial claims of both the China
Criticism
Certain traits assigned by past scholars to "conquest dynasties" to distinguish them from "native" dynasties may not have been so distinguishing An example is the "royal hunt" which according to David M Robinson "originated in China in a complex legacy of venerable Zhongyuan
 List of nonHan dynasties 
This list includes only the major dynasties of China ruled by nonHan ethnicities there were many other such dynastic regimes that ruled an area historically or currently associated with "China" not shown in this list Also not all nonHan regimes are seen as conquest dynasties and many of them are actually considered as "infiltration dynasties"
