"Four Barbarians" () was a term used by subjects of the Zhou dynasty
Etymology

History of ChinaAncient China
The Four Barbarians were the Dongyi ləj (eastern foreigners)
 mˤron (southern foreigners)
 nuŋ (western foreigners)
 lˤek (northern foreigners) Scholars such as Herrlee Glessner Creel argue that Yi Man Rong and Di were originally Chinese names of particular ethnic groups or tribes During the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC) these four exonyms were expanded into "general designations referring to the barbarian tribes" in a given cardinal direction For example "Yi" became "Dongyi" literally meaning "East(ern) Yi" The Russian anthropologist Mikhail Kryukov concludes:
<blockquote>This would in the final analysis mean that once again territory had become the primary criterion of the wegroup whereas the consciousness of common origin remained secondary What continued to be important were the factors of language the acceptance of certain forms of material culture the adherence to certain rituals and above all the economy and the way of life Agriculture was the only appropriate way of life for the Huaxia </blockquote>

In Chinese the term "Four Barbarians" uses the character for Yi (wikt:夷
The modern character for yi (wikt:夷
"Four barbarians" is the common English translation of Siyi Compare these ChineseEnglish dictionary equivalents for Siyi: "the four barbarian tribes on the borders of ancient China" "the barbarians on borders of China" and "four barbarian tribes on the borders" Some scholars interpret the si "four" in Siyi as sifang (四方 "four directions") Liu Xiaoyuan says the meaning of Siyi "is not four barbarians but numerous barbarous tribes in the four directions" However Liu also states that the term yi might have been used by the early Chinese to simply mean "ordinary others" Yuri Pines translates Siyi as "barbarians of the four corners"

In Chinese Buddhism siyi (四夷) or siyijie (四夷戒) abbreviates the si boluoyi (四波羅夷) "Four Parajikas" (grave offenses that entail expulsion of a monk or nun from the sangha)

Expanding upon the research of Li Ling (sinologist)
Chen analyzed diachronic semantic changes in the twin concepts of Xia and Yi During the Western Zhou they were employed to distinguish "between the Zhou elite and nonZhou people"; during the Eastern Zhou they distinguished "between the central states and peripheral barbarian tribes in a geographical sense as well as between Zhou subjects and nonZhou subjects in a political sense" Eastern Zhou canonical texts says Chen "frequently assert a differentiation between Xia (or Zhongguo) meaning those states in the central plains subject to the Zhou sovereign and Yi 夷 Di 狄 Rong 戎 and Man 蠻 all of which could be used generally to refer to nonChinese ethnic groups" Among these four terms Yi was most widely employed for "barbarian" clans tribes or ethnic groups The Chinese classics used it in directional compounds (eg "eastern" Dongyi 東夷 "western" Xiyi 西夷 "southern" Nanyi and "northern" Beiyi 北夷) numerical (meaning "many") generalizations ("three" Sanyi 三夷 "four" Siyi 四夷 and "nine" Jiuyi 九夷) and groups in specific areas and states (Huaiyi 淮夷 Chu (state)
Historians Liu Junping and Huang Deyuan describe how early Chinese monarchs used the concept of the Four Barbarians to justify their rule Just how yin and yang
Eastern Zhou usages
The Chinese classics contain many references to the Siyi "Four Barbarians" Around the late Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BCE) or early Warring States period (475–221 BCE) the names Man Yi Rong and Di became firmly associated with the cardinal directions Yi changed from meaning a specific "barbarians in the east" to "barbarians" generally and two new words – Siyi and ManYiRongDi 蠻夷戎狄 – referred to "all nonZhou barbarians in the four directions" The Zuozhuan and Mozi contain the earliest extant occurrences of Siyi

The (early 4th century BCE) Zuozhuan commentary to the Chunqiu ("Spring and Autumn Annals") uses Siyi four times 
<blockquote>The affair presenting Rong prisoners and spoils of war to Duke Zhuang was contrary to rule When a prince has gained success over any of the wild tribes he presents the spoils to the king who employs them to terrify other tribes </blockquote>
<blockquote>It is virtue by which the people of the Middle State are cherished; it is by severity that the wild tribes around are awed </blockquote>
<blockquote>I have heard that when the officers of the son of Heaven are not properly arranged we may learn from the wild tribes all about </blockquote>
<blockquote>Anciently the defenses of the sons of Heaven were the rude tribes on every side of the kingdom; and when their authority became low their defenses were the various States </blockquote>
In addition the Zuozhuan has an early usage of ManYiRongDi 蠻夷戎狄 meaning "all kinds of barbarians" 
<blockquote>When any of the wild tribes south east west or north do not obey the kings commands and by their dissoluteness and drunkenness are violating all the duties of society the king gives command to attack them </blockquote>

The (c 4th century BCE) Mozi has one occurrence of Siyi referring to King Wu of Zhou
<blockquote>After King Wu had conquered the Shang dynasty and received the gifts bestowed by God he assigned guardians to the various spirits instituted sacrifices to Zhous ancestors the former kings of Shang and opened up communications with the barbarians of the four quarters so that there was no one in the world who did not pay him allegiance </blockquote>

The (c 4th century BCE) Guanzi (text)<blockquote>Further to the west he subjugated the Western Yu of Liusha and for the first time the Rong people of Qin were obedient Therefore even though the soldiers went forth only once their great accomplishments victories numbered twelve and as a consequence none of the eastern Yi western Rong southern Man northern Di or the feudal lords of the central states failed to submit </blockquote>
This text also recommends "To use the states bordering the four seas to attack other states bordering the four seas is a condition distinguishing the central states"

The (c 4th century BCE) Confucian Analects does not use Siyi but does use Jiuyi 九夷 "Nine Barbarians" (9/19) "The Master wanted to settle among the Nine Wild Tribes of the East Someone said I am afraid you would find it hard to put up with their lack of refinement The Master said Were a true gentleman to settle among them there would soon be no trouble about lack of refinement" Yidi 夷狄 "Eastern and Northern Barbarians" occurs twice "The Master said The barbarians of the East and North have retained their princes They are not in such a state of decay as we in China"; "The Master said In private life courteous in public life diligent in relationships loyal This is a maxim that no matter where you may be even amid the barbarians of the east or north may never be set aside" This text has an indirect reference to "barbarians" (5/6) "The Master said The Way makes no progress I shall get upon a raft and float out to sea"

The (c 290 BCE) Confucianist Mencius (book)
The Mencius uses western Xiyi 西夷 four times (three contrasting with northern Beidi 北狄) eastern Dongyi 東夷 once and Yidi 夷狄 once Three repeated Xiyi occurrences (1B/11) describe Tang of Shang establishing the Shang Dynasty: "With this he gained the trust of the Empire and when he marched on the east the western barbarians complained and when he marched on the south the northern barbarians complained They all said Why does he not come to us first?" Dongyi occurs in a claim (4B/1) that the legendary Chinese sages Shun (Chinese leader)
The (c 3rd century BCE) Xunzi (book)<blockquote>If your deportment is respectful and reverent your heart loyal and faithful if you use only those methods sanctioned by ritual principles and moral duty and if your emotional disposition is one of love and humanity then though you travel throughout the empire and though you find yourself reduced to living among the Four Yi 夷 tribes everyone would consider you to be an honorable person If you strive to be the first to undertake toilsome and bitter tasks and can leave pleasant and rewarding tasks to others if you are proper diligent sincere and trustworthy if you take responsibility and oversee it meticulously then wherever you travel in the civilized world and though you find yourself reduced to living with the Four Tribes everyone would be willing to entrust you with official duties </blockquote>
John Knoblock notes "The Four Yi tribes refers to the barbarians surrounding the Chinese "Middle Kingdom" and does not designate particular peoples" The Xunzi uses ManYiRongDi once
<blockquote>Accordingly 諸夏 all the states of Xia Chinese have identical obligations for service to the king and have identical standards of conduct The countries of Man Yi Rong and Di barbarians perform the same obligatory services to the kind but the regulations governing them are not the same … The Man and Yi nations do service according to treaty obligations The Rong and Di do irregular service </blockquote>

The (3rd–1st centuries BCE) Liji uses Siyi once
<blockquote>But if it be his character when he finds men of ability to be jealous and hate them; and when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men to oppose them and not allow their advancement showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?" It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him driving him out among the barbarous tribes around determined not to dwell along with him in the Middle Kingdom </blockquote>
The Liji also gives detailed information about the Four Barbarian peoples <blockquote>The people of those wufang 五方 five regions – the Middle states and the Rong Yi (and other wild tribes round them) – had all their several natures which they could not be made to alter The tribes on the east were called Yi They had their hair unbound and tattooed their bodies Some of them ate their food without its being cooked Those on the south were called Man They tattooed their foreheads and had their feet turned in towards each other Some of them (also) ate their food without its being cooked Those on the west were called Rong They had their hair unbound and wore skins Some of them did not eat grainfood Those on the north were called Di They wore skins of animals and birds and dwelt in caves Some of them also did not eat grainfood The people of the Middle states and of those Yi Man Rong and Di all had their dwellings where they lived at ease; their flavours which they preferred; the clothes suitable for them; their proper implements for use; and their vessels which they prepared in abundance In those five regions the languages of the people were not mutually intelligible and their likings and desires were different To make what was in their minds apprehended and to communicate their likings and desires (there were officers) – in the east called transmitters; in the south representationists; in the west Didis; and in the north interpreters </blockquote>

The Shujing history uses Siyi in two forged "Old Text" chapters
<blockquote>Yi said Alas! be cautious! Admonish yourself to caution when there seems to be no occasion for anxiety Do not fail to observe the laws and ordinances … Do not go against what is right to get the praise of the people Do not oppose the peoples (wishes) to follow your own desires (Attend to these things) without idleness or omission and the barbarous tribes all around will come and acknowledge your sovereignty </blockquote>
<blockquote>The king said Oh! GrandMaster the security or the danger of the kingdom depends on those officers of Yin If you are not (too) stern with them nor (too) mild their virtue will be truly cultivated … The penetrating power of your principles and the good character of your measures of government will exert an enriching influence on the character of the people so that the wild tribes with their coats buttoning on the left will all find their proper support in them and I the little child will long enjoy much happiness </blockquote>

The (c 239 BCE) Lüshi Chunqiu has two occurrences of Siyi
<blockquote>Seeking depth not breadth reverently guarding one affair … When this ability is utterly perfect the barbarian Yi states of the four quarters are tranquil (17/5)</blockquote>
<blockquote>If your desires are not proper and you use them to govern your state it will perish Therefore the sagekings of antiquity paid particular attention to conforming to the endowment Heaven gave them in acting on their desires; all the people therefore could be commanded and all their accomplishments were firmly established "The sagekings held fast to the One and the barbarians of the four directions came to them" refers to this (19/6) </blockquote>

The Daoist Zhuangzi (book)<blockquote>The sword of the son of heaven has a point made of Swallow Gorge and Stone Wall … It is embraced by the four uncivilized tribes encircled by the four seasons and wrapped around by the Sea of Po (30) </blockquote>
<blockquote>Master Mo declared "Long ago when Yü was trying to stem the flood waters he cut channels from the Yangtze and the Yellow rivers and opened communications with the four uncivilized tribes and the nine regions (33) </blockquote>

Han usages
Many texts dating from the Han Dynasty (206 BCE220 CE) used the ethnonyms Yi and Siyi

For example the (139 BCE) Huainanzi which is an eclectic compilation attributed to Liu An uses Siyi "Four Barbarians" in three chapters (and Jiuyi "Nine Barbarians" in two)
<blockquote>Yu the Great<blockquote>The Three Miao tribes bind their heads with hemp; the Qiang people bind their necks: the people of the Middle Kingdom use hat and hatpin; the Yue people shear their hair In regard to getting dressed they are as one … Thus the rites of the four Yi "barbarians" are not the same yet they all revere their ruler love their kin and respect their elder brothers (117) </blockquote>
<blockquote>When Shun was the Son of Heaven he plucked the fivestringed Guqin<blockquote>Thus when the Son of Heaven attains the Way he is secure even among the four Yi tribes of "barbarians"; when the son of Heaven loses the way he is secure only among the Lords of the Land (2029) </blockquote>

References to the "Four Barbarians" are especially common among Hanera histories; Siyi occurs 18 times in the Shiji 62 in the Han Shu and 30 in the Hou Han Shu

To evaluate the traditional "civilized vs barbarian" dichotomy that many scholars use as a blanket description of Chinese attitudes towards outsiders Erica Brindley examined how the Chinese classics ethnically described the southern Baiyue
Brindley further notes that
<blockquote>I translate "Man Yi" above as "Southern barbarian" and not just as the Man and Yi peoples because it is clear that Sima Qian does not think of them as two distinct groups Rather it appears that the term Yi does not point to any particular group … but to a vague category of degraded other Man on the other hand denotes not the specific name of the group ("Yue") but the general southern location of this specific derogatory other In the literary tradition the four directions (north south east west) are linked with four general categories of identification denoting a derogatory other (di man yi rong)</blockquote>

In the end Brindley concludes that
<blockquote>Much scholarship dealing with the relationship between self and other in Chinese history assumes a simple bifurcation between civilized Chinese or Han peoples and the barbarian other In this analysis of the concepts of the Yue and Yue ethnicity I show that such a simple and valueladen categorization did not always exist and that some early authors differentiated between themselves and others in a much more complicated and sometimes conflicted manner</blockquote>

The complexities of the meaning and usage of Yi is also shown in the Hou Han Shu where in its chapter on the Dongyi the books describes the Dongyi countries as places where benevolence rules and the gentlemen do not die

The Shuowen Jiezi (121 CE) character dictionary defines yi as "men of the east” (東方之人也)

Later usages
Chinese Yi "barbarian" and Siyi continued to be used long after the Han dynasty as illustrated by the following examples from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) and Qing Dynasty (1644–1912)

The Dutch sinologist Kristofer Schipper cites a (c 5th–6th century) Celestial Masters Daoist document (Xiaren Siyi shou yaolu 下人四夷受要籙) that substitutes Qiang (historical people)
Sìyí guǎn  (lit "Four Barbarians building") was the name of the Ming dynasty
In 1656 the Qing imperial court issued an edict to Mongolia about a territorial dispute "Those barbarians (fanyi) who paid tribute to Mongolia during the Ming should be administered by Mongolia However those barbarians submitting to the former Ming court should be subjects of China"

After China began expansion into Inner Asia Gang Zhao says "Its inhabitants were no longer to be considered barbarians a term suitable for the tributary countries and an error on this score could be dangerous" In a 1787 memorial sent to the Qianlong Emperor the Shaanxi governor mistakenly called a Tibetan mission an yísh3 夷使  "barbarian mission" The emperor replied "Because Tibet has long been incorporated into our territory it is completely different from Russia which submits to our country only in name Thus we cannot see the Tibetans as foreign barbarians unlike the Russians"

The use of Yí 夷 continued into modern times The Oxford English Dictionary defines barbarian (3c) as "Applied by the Chinese contemptuously to foreigners" and cites the 1858 Treaty of Tientsin prohibiting the Chinese from calling the British "Yí" (s:Treaty of TienTsin between the Queen of Great Britain and the Emperor of China<blockquote>The law simply secures a threeway commensurability of the heterolinguistic sign 夷/i/barbarian by joining the written Chinese character the romanized pronunciation and the English translation together into a coherent semantic unit Which means that the Chinese character yi becomes a heterolinguistic sign by virtue of being informed signified and transformed by the English word "barbarian" and must defer its correct meaning to the foreign counterpart  That is to say whoever violates the integrity of the supersign 夷/i/barbarian  risks violating international law itself </blockquote>
