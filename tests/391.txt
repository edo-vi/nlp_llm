 Philosophical views 

Floridi is one of the leading thinkers in the emerging disciplines of the philosophy of information the philosophy of technology information ethics and the ethics of AI His work has helped to establish the philosophical and ethical study of information as a distinct and important field of inquiry

Floridis work focuses on the philosophical ethical social and political implications of the increasing role that information and communication technologies play in our lives He is particularly concerned with the increasing digitization of our world the conceptual and ethical implications of the changing relationship between humans and technology and the need for a new philosophical framework to accommodate these changes

He argues that we need to develop a new ethical approach to understand and shape the changes brought about by the information revolution and that the latest developments in technology and science must inform this approach He has been instrumental in promoting the development of digital ethics interacting with governments and companies worldwide

One of Floridis key contributions is his formulation of the Philosophy of Information (PoI) The PoI provides a framework for understanding the nature of information and its role in the world According to Floridi information is a vital resource that shapes our knowledge and understanding of the world It is not simply a neutral representation of reality but a part of the world with its own properties effects and moral implications

Floridis PoI has several key components including an ontology of information which defines the nature of information an ethics of information which provides a framework for evaluating the moral implications of information and information technologies an epistemology of information that analyses the role of information in the development of knowledge and science and a logic of information the concentrates on the more formal aspects The PoI also includes a theory of the information environment the infosphere which encompasses the physical social and cultural contexts in which information is produced used and communicated

Floridis work has profoundly impacted the field of digital ethics and the philosophy and ethics of AI and has helped establish them as distinct and important areas of inquiry He has written more than 300 papers and many books on the subject including:

"Information: A Very Short Introduction" (OUP 2010)  An overview of the concept of information including its history definition and applications
