A possibly ongoing outbreak of Langya henipavirus (LayV) was reported in China in August 2022 with 35 identified cases spanning from 2018 to August 2022  The index case was a 53yearold female farmer who had been in contact with shrews and presented with a fever headache cough and nausea in Qingdao City
The virus does not appear to spread easily from person to person consistent with the 35 reported cases being apparently independent from one another  In 26 of the 35 human cases reported in China the only identified infectious agent was LayV; in the LayVonly cases symptoms appeared such as fever fatigue and coughing No deaths due to LayV had been reported as of August 2022

LayV infection is a respiratory zoonotic disease which has been shown to be present in goats and dogs where shrews appear to be a viral reservoir species  LayV is closely related to Hendra virus and Nipah virus both of which cause respiratory infections that can be fatal and both of which show low persontoperson transmissibility  The exact method of transmission between animals and from animal to person remains unknown  The closest viral strain match to LayV is Mojiang henipavirus (MojV) discovered in 2012 in rats in southern China and responsible for several fatal respiratory infections

Initial detection of the virus was made during an infection surveillance study at three hospitals in Eastern China involving patients exhibiting a fever
