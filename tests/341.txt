In 1951 exotica musician and organist Korla Pandit left his KTLA show Adventures in Music to work with Snader resulting in short films which gave Pandit a national TV audience However in 1953 problems with contract negotiations prompted Snader to replace Pandit with Liberace which launched the pianist to fame Pandit then hosted a show on KGOTV in San Francisco
