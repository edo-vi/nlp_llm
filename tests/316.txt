File:Culex mosquito life cycle en.svgIn biology a biological life cycle (or just life cycle when the biological context is clear) is a series of stages of the life of an organism that begins as a zygote often in an egg and concludes as an adult that reproduces producing an offspring in the form of a new zygote which then itself goes through the same series of stages the process repeating in a cyclic fashion.

"The concept is closely related to those of the life history Developmental biology
In some organisms different "generations" of the species succeed each other during the life cycle. For Embryophyte
Life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating haploid (n) and diploid (2n) stages i.e. a change of ploidy is involved. To return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage meiosis must occur. In regard to changes of ploidy there are three types of cycles:
*haplontic life cycle — the haploid stage is multicellular and the diploid stage is a single cell meiosis is "zygotic".
*diplontic life cycle — the diploid stage is multicellular and haploid gametes are formed meiosis is "gametic".
*haplodiplontic life cycle (also referred to as diplohaplontic diplobiontic or dibiontic life cycle) — multicellular diploid and haploid stages occur meiosis is "sporic".

The cycles differ in when mitosis (growth) occurs. Zygotic meiosis and gametic meiosis have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the n phase in zygotic meiosis and during the 2n phase in gametic meiosis. Therefore zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed "haplobiontic" (single mitotic phase not to be confused with haplontic). Sporic meiosis on the other hand has mitosis in two stages both the diploid and haploid stages termed "diplobiontic" (not to be confused with diplontic).

Discovery
The study of reproduction and Embryogenesis
Wilhelm Hofmeister demonstrated that alternation of generations is a feature that unites plants and published this result in 1851 (see History of botanyPlant sexuality
Some terms (haplobiont and diplobiont) used for the description of life cycles were proposed initially for algae by Nils Svedelius and then became used for other organisms. Other terms (autogamy and gamontogamy) used in protist life cycles were introduced by Karl Gottlieb Grell. The description of the complex life cycles of various organisms contributed to the disproof of the ideas of spontaneous generation in the 1840s and 1850s.

Haplontic life cycle
File:Haploid English.svgA zygotic meiosis is a meiosis of a zygote immediately after karyogamy which is the fusion of two cell nucleus
In the whole cycle zygotes are the only diploid cell; mitosis occurs only in the haploid phase.

The individuals or cells as a result of mitosis are haplonts hence this life cycle is also called haplontic life cycle. Haplonts are:

* In archaeplastidans: some green algae (e.g. Chlamydomonas Zygnema Chara (alga)* In stramenopiles: some golden algae
* In alveolates: many dinoflagellates e.g. Ceratium Gymnodinium some apicomplexans (e.g. Plasmodium)
* In rhizarians: some euglyphids ascetosporeans
* In Excavata* In amoebozoans: Dictyostelium
* In opisthokonts: most fungi (some chytrids zygomycetes some ascomycetes basidiomycetes)

Diplontic life cycle
File:Diploid English.svg
In gametic meiosis instead of immediately dividing meiotically to produce haploid cells the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid individual or a group of more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or gametes. Haploid cells may divide again (by mitosis) to form more haploid cells as in many yeasts but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.

In the whole cycle gametes are usually the only haploid cells and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase.

The diploid multicellular individual is a diplont hence a gametic meiosis is also called a diplontic life cycle. Diplonts are:

* In archaeplastidans: some green algae (e.g. Cladophora* In stramenopiles: some brown algae (the Fucales however their life cycle can also be interpreted as strongly heteromorphic-diplohaplontic with a highly reduced gametophyte phase as in the flowering plants) some xanthophytes (e.g. Vaucheria) most diatoms some "heliozoans" (e.g. Actinophrys Actinosphaerium)
* In alveolates: ciliates  
* In Excavata* In opisthokonts: animals some fungi (e.g. some ascomycetes)

Haplodiplontic life cycle
File:Diplohaplontic English.svg
In sporic meiosis (also commonly known as intermediary meiosis) the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which also then divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called gametophytes. The gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis. In some plants the gametophyte is not only small-sized but also short-lived; in other plants and many algae the gametophyte is the "dominant" stage of the life cycle.

Haplodiplonts are:

* In archaeplastidans: red algae (which have two sporophyte generations) some green algae (e.g. Ulva (genus)* In stramenopiles: most brown algae
* In rhizarians: many foraminiferans plasmodiophoromycetes
* In amoebozoa: myxogastrids
* In opisthokonts: some fungi (some chytrids some ascomycetes like the brewers yeast)
* Other eukaryotes: haptophytes

Some animals have a sex-determination system called haplodiploid but this is not related to the haplodiplontic life cycle.

 Vegetative meiosis 
Some red algae (such as Bonnemaisonia and Lemanea) and green algae (such as Prasiola) have vegetative meiosis also called somatic meiosis which is a rare phenomenon. Vegetative meiosis can occur in haplodiplontic and also in diplontic life cycles. The gametophytes remain attached to and part of the sporophyte. Vegetative (non-reproductive) diploid cells undergo meiosis generating vegetative haploid cells. These undergo many mitosis and produces gametes.

A different phenomenon called vegetative diploidization a type of apomixis occurs in some brown algae (e.g. Elachista stellaris). Cells in a haploid part of the plant spontaneously duplicate their chromosomes to produce diploid tissue.

Parasitic life cycle

Parasites depend on the exploitation of one or more host (biology)
Those parasites that infect a single species have direct life cycles. An example of a parasite with a direct life cycle is Ancylostoma caninum or the canine hookworm. They develop to the infective larval stage in the environment then penetrate the skin of the dog directly and mature to adults in the small intestine.

If a parasite has to infect a given host in order to complete its life cycle then it is said to be an obligate parasite of that host; sometimes infection is Facultative parasite
A host in which parasites reproduce sexually is known as the definitive final or primary host. In intermediate hosts parasites either do not reproduce or do so asexually but the parasite always develops to a new stage in this type of host. In some cases a parasite will infect a host but not undergo any development these hosts are known as paratenic or transport hosts. The paratenic host can be useful in raising the chance that the parasite will be transmitted to the definitive host. For example the cat lungworm (Aelurostrongylus abstrusus) uses a slug or snail as an intermediate host; the first stage larva enters the mollusk and develops to the third stage larva which is infectious to the definitive host—the cat. If a mouse eats the slug the third stage larva will enter the mouses tissues but will not undergo any development.

Evolution
The primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction. However these eukaryotes probably are not primitively asexual but have lost their sexual reproduction or it just was not observed yet. Many eukaryotes (including animals and plants) exhibit asexual reproduction which may be facultative or obligate in the life cycle with sexual reproduction occurring more or less frequently.

Individual organisms participating in a biological life cycle ordinarily age and die while cells from these organisms that connect successive life cycle generations (germ line cells and their descendants) are potentially immortal. The basis for this difference is a fundamental problem in biology.  The Russian biologist and historian Zhores A. Medvedev considered that the accuracy of genome replicative and other synthetic systems alone cannot explain the immortality of germ lines. Rather Medvedev thought that known features of the biochemistry and genetics of sexual reproduction indicate the presence of unique information maintenance and restoration processes at the gametogenesis stage of the biological life cycle. In particular Medvedev considered that the most important opportunities for information maintenance of germ cells are created by genetic recombination
The ancestry of each present day cell presumably traces back in an unbroken lineage for over 3 billion years to the abiogenesis
