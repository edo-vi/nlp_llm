The goal of computational creativity is to model simulate or replicate creativity using a computer to achieve one of several ends:

 To construct a computer program To better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans
 To design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves

The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity with one strand of work informing the other

The applied form of computational creativity is known as media synthesis (AI)
Theoretical issues
Theoretical approaches concern the essence of creativity Especially under what circumstances it is possible to call the model a "creative" if eminent creativity is about rulebreaking or the disavowal of convention This is a variant of Ada Lovelaces objection to machine intelligence as recapitulated by modern theorists such as Teresa Amabile If a machine can do only what it was programmed to do how can its behavior ever be called creative?

Indeed not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do—a key point in favor of computational creativity

Defining creativity in computational terms
Because no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity the AI researchers Newell Shaw and Simon developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multipronged view of creativity one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative:
 The answer is novel and useful (either for the individual or for society)
 The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted
 The answer results from intense motivation and persistence
 The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague

Whereas the above reflects a topdown approach to computational creativity an alternative thread has developed among bottomup computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research During the late 1980s and early 1990s for example such generative neural systems were driven by genetic algorithms Experiments involving recurrent nets were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations

Machine learning for computational creativity 
File:An_astronaut_riding_a_horse_(da_Vinci)_20220828pngWhile traditional computational approaches to creativity rely on the explicit formulation of prescriptions by developers and a certain degree of randomness in computer programs machine learning methods allow computer programs to learn on heuristics from input data enabling creative capacities within the computer programs Especially deep artificial neural networks allow to learn patterns from input data that allow for the nonlinear generation of creative artefacts Before 1989 artificial neural networks have been used to model certain aspects of creativity Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces Then he used a change algorithm to modify the networks input parameters  The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner  In 1992 Todd extended this work using the socalled distal teacher approach that had been developed by Paul Munro Paul Werbos  D Nguyen and Bernard Widrow   Michael I Jordan and David Rumelhart In the new approach there are two neural networks one of which is supplying training patterns to another 
In later efforts by Todd a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space position them on a 2d plane with a mousebased graphic interface and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies and listen to the new "interpolated" melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the 2d plane

Key concepts from the literature
Some highlevel and philosophical themes recur throughout the field of computational creativity

Important categories of creativity
Margaret Boden  refers to creativity that is novel merely to the agent that produces it as "Pcreativity" (or "psychological creativity") and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel by society at large as "Hcreativity" (or "historical creativity") Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls "V" or "Visceral creativity" wherein significance is invented through neural mapping to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture with the "gateway" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context An important variety of such Vcreativity is consciousness itself wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activate turnover within the brain Valuedriven creativity gives more freedom and autonomy to the AI system

Exploratory and transformational creativity
Boden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space She labels the former as exploratory creativity and the latter as transformational creativity seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical challenging and rarer than the former Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1) but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a wellunderstood space (criterion 3)  while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4)  Bodens insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance However Bodens insights are also the subject of formalization most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins

Generation and evaluation
The criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases generation and evaluation In the first phase novel (to the system itself thus PCreative)  constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage This body of potentially creative constructs is then evaluated to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not This twophase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke Ward and Smith which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity

 Cocreation 
While much of computational creativity research focuses on independent and automatic machinebased creativity generation many researchers are inclined towards a collaboration approach This humancomputer interaction is sometimes categorized under the creativity support tools development These systems aim to provide an ideal framework for research integration decisionmaking and idea generation Recently deep learning approaches to imaging sound and natural language processing resulted in the modeling of productive creativity development frameworks

 Innovation 
Computational creativity is increasingly being discussed in the innovation and management literature as the recent development in AI may disrupt entire innovation processes and fundamentally change how innovations will be created Philip Hutchinson  highlights the relevance of computational creativity for creating innovation and introduced the concept  of “selfinnovating artificial intelligence” (SAI) to describe how companies make us of AI in innovation processes to enhance their innovative offerings SAI is defined as the organizational utilization of AI with the aim of incrementally advancing existing or developing new products based on insights from continuously combining and analyzing multiple data sources As AI becomes a Generalpurpose technology
Combinatorial creativity
A great deal perhaps all of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of preexisting ideas or objects Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include:
Placing a familiar object in an unfamiliar setting (eg Marcel Duchamps Fountain (Duchamp)Blending two superficially different objects or genres (eg a scifi story set in the Wild West with robot cowboys as in Westworld (film)Comparing a familiar object to a superficially unrelated and semantically distant concept (eg "Makeup is the Western BurqaAdding a new and unexpected feature to an existing concept (eg adding a scalpel to a Swiss Army knife; adding a camera phoneCompressing two incongruous scenarios into the same narrative to get a joke (eg the Emo Philips joke "Women are always using men to advance their careers Damned anthropologists!")
Using an iconic image from one domain in a domain for an unrelated or incongruous idea or product (eg using the Marlboro Man image to sell cars or to advertise the dangers of smokingrelated impotence)
The combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations or through a rulebased or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations Genetic algorithms and neural networks can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs

Conceptual blending

Mark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon Arthur Koestlers ideas about The Act of Creation
</ref> by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into mental spaces and conceptual metaphors Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces:

A first input space (contains one conceptual structure or mental space)
A second input space (to be blended with the first input)
A generic space of stock conventions and imageschemas that allow the input spaces to be understood from an integrated perspective
A blend space in which a selected projection of elements from both input spaces are combined; inferences arising from this combination also reside here sometimes leading to emergent structures that conflict with the inputs

Fauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a wellformed integration network In essence they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations  For example a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend

Some computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending preexisting computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures In 2006 Francisco Câmara Pereira presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from symbolic AI and genetic algorithms to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form; his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining 3D graphical models

Linguistic creativity
Language provides continuous opportunity for creativity evident in the generation of novel sentences phrasings puns neologisms rhymes allusions sarcasm irony similes metaphors analogy
Hypothesis of creative patterns
In the seminal work of applied linguist Ronald Carter he hypothesized two main creativity types involving words and word patterns: patternreforming creativity and patternforming creativity

Story generation
Substantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the 1970s with the development of James Meehans TALESPIN
 system TALESPIN viewed stories as narrative descriptions of a problemsolving effort and created stories by first establishing a goal for the storys characters so that their search for a solution could be tracked and recorded The MINSTREL system represents a complex elaboration of this basic approach distinguishing a range of characterlevel goals in the story from a range of authorlevel goals for the story Systems like Bringsjords BRUTUS elaborate these ideas further to create stories with complex interpersonal themes like betrayal Nonetheless MINSTREL explicitly models the creative process with a set of Transform Recall Adapt Methods (TRAMs) to create novel scenes from old The MEXICA model of Rafael Pérez y Pérez and Mike Sharples is more explicitly interested in the creative process of storytelling and implements a version of the engagementreflection cognitive model of creative writing

Metaphor and simile
Example of a metaphor: "She was an ape"

Example of a simile: "Felt like a tigerfur blanket"
The computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledgebased process Computationalists such as Yorick Wilks James Martin Dan Fass John Barnden and Mark Lee have developed knowledgebased approaches to the processing of metaphors either at a linguistic level or a logical level Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system called Sardonicus that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web; these similes are then tagged as bonafide (eg "as hard as steel") or ironic (eg "as hairy as a bowling ball" "as pleasant as a endodontic therapy
Analogy
The process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies The dominant school of research as advanced by Dedre Gentner views analogy as a structurepreserving process; this view has been implemented in the structure mapping engine or SME the MAC/FAC retrieval engine (Many Are Called Few Are Chosen) ACME (Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine) and ARCS (Analogical Retrieval Constraint System) Other mappingbased approaches include Sapper which situates the mapping process in a semanticnetwork model of memory Analogy is a very active subarea of creative computation and creative cognition; active figures in this subarea include Douglas Hofstadter Paul Thagard and Keith Holyoak Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littmans machine learning approach to the solving of SATstyle analogy problems; their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests

Joke generation


Humour is an especially knowledgehungry process and the most successful jokegeneration systems to date have focussed on pungeneration as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie This work includes the JAPE (software)
Neologism
The blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language; these new words are commonly called "blends" or "portmanteau words" (after Lewis Carroll) Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist that harvests neological headwords from Wikipedia and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in WordNet ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own; the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words (eg "food traveller" for "gastronaut" and "time traveller" for "wikt:chrononaut
A Corpus linguistics
In terms of linguistic research in neologism Stefan Th Gries has performed a quantitative analysis of blend structure in English and found that "the degree of recognizability of the source words and that the similarity of source words to the blend plays a vital role in blend formation" The results were validated through a comparison of intentional blends to speecherror blends

Poetry

Like jokes poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints and no generalpurpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning phrasing structure and rhyme aspects of poetry Nonetheless Pablo Gervás has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a casebased reasoning (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a casebase of existing poems Each poem fragment in the ASPERA casebase is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment Meter (poetry)
Musical creativity

Computational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians and on the generation of music for performance by computers The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of Mozart and Bach) and jazz<ref>cite journal</ref> Most notably David Cope has written a software system called "Experiments in Musical Intelligence" (or "EMI")  that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style EMIs output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is humangenerated to a high level of competence

In the field of contemporary classical music Iamus (computer)
Creativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played and planning ahead for what might be played next
The robot Shimon developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech has demonstrated jazz improvisation Virtual improvisation software based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by Gerard Assayag and Shlomo Dubnov include OMax SoMax and PyOracle are used to create improvisations in realtime by reinjecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from live performer

In 1994 a Creativity Machine architecture (see above) was able to generate 11000 musical hooks by training a synaptically perturbed neural net on 100 melodies that had appeared on the top ten list over the last 30 years In 1996 a selfbootstrapping Creativity Machine observed audience facial expressions through an advanced machine vision system and perfected its musical talents to generate an album entitled "Song of the Neurons"

In the field of musical composition the patented works by RenéLouis Baron allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies socalled "coherent" in any musical style All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters can influence and develop each of these songs (in realtime while listening to the song) The patented invention RenéLouis BaronInventor27s path
Visual and artistic creativity
Computational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art A wellknown program in this domain is Harold Cohen (artist)
Other software artists of note include the NEvAr system (for "neuroevolution
The Painting Fool developed by Simon Colton originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles colour palettes and brush types Given its dependence on an input source image to work with the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of or lack of creativity in a computational art system Nonetheless The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images much as AARON does from its own limited imagination Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (eg these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more colorsaturated while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller) Artistically the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction etc) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter

The artist Krasi Dimtch (Krasimira Dimtchevska) and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rulebased generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color shape and size palettes The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or/and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder

An emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook One important aspect is Mechanic Miner a system that can generate short segments of code that act as simple game mechanics ANGELINA can evaluate these mechanics for usefulness by playing simple unsolvable game levels and testing to see if the new mechanic makes the level solvable Sometimes Mechanic Miner discovers bugs in the code and exploits these to make new mechanics for the player to solve problems with

In July 2015 Google released DeepDream – an Opensource software                
In August 2015 researchers from Tübingen Germany created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a Picasso or Van Gogh in about an hour Their algorithm is put into use in the website DeepArt that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm

In early 2016 a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects (eg chess problems paintings music) using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube

Creativity in problem solving
Creativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in problem solving In psychology and cognitive science this research area is called creative problem solving The ExplicitImplicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity has been implemented using a CLARION (cognitive architecture)
Debate about "general" theories of creativity
Some researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it We can describe not just the agent of creativity as "creative" but also the product and the method Consequently it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a general theory of creativity Nonetheless some generative principles are more general than others leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are "general theories" Stephen Thaler for instance proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough and general enough to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities

Criticism of computational creativity


Traditional computers as mainly used in the computational creativity application do not support creativity as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions  As such a computer cannot be creative as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms Related discussions and references to related work are captured in work on philosophical foundations of simulation

Mathematically the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity but it is not real creativity as nothing new is created just transformed in well defined algorithms
