A literary genre is a category of literature Genres may be determined by literary technique setting tone
Genres can all be in the form of prose or poetry Additionally a genre such as satire allegory or pastoral might appear in any of the above not only as a subgenre (see below) but as a mixture of genres  they are defined by the general cultural movement of the historical period in which they were composed

 History of genres 
File:Allegories of literary genrejpg
 Aristotle 
The concept of genre began in the works of Aristotle who applied biological concepts to the classification of literary genres or as he called them "species" (eidÄ“) These classifications are mainly discussed in his treatises Rhetoric (Aristotle)
Genres are categories into which kinds of literary material are organized The genres Aristotle discusses include the epic the tragedy the comedy dithyrambic poetry and phallic songs Genres are often divided into complex subcategories For example the novel is a large genre of narrative fiction; within the category of the novel the detective novel is a subgenre while the "hardboiled" detective novel is a subgenre of the detective novel

In the Rhetoric Aristotle proposed three literary genres of rhetorical oratory: Deliberative rhetoric
In the Poetics Aristotle similarly divided poetry into three main genres: the Epic poetry
 Further development of genre 
After the time of Aristotle literary criticism continued to develop The firstcentury Greek treatise "On the Sublime" for example discussed the works of more than 50 literary writers and the methods they used to influence their audiences emotions and feelings

 Romantic genre theory 
The origins of modern Western genre theory can be traced to the European Romanticism
The idea that it was possible to ignore genre constraints and the idea that each literary work was a "genre unto itself" gained popularity Genre definitions were thought to be "primitive and childish"

At the same time the Romantic period saw the emergence of a new genre the imaginative genre The reason for this shift is often attributed to the social events that were taking place in the Western world in terms of wars infighting and overthrown leadership  People felt the need for "escapism" to remove themselves from their respective situations 

 Northrop Frye 

In 1957 Canadian scholar Northrop Frye published "Anatomy of Criticism" in which he proposes a system of genres and a set of rules to describe the constraints of each genre In this work he defines methodological classifications of the genres of myth legend high mimetic genre low mimetic genre irony the Comedy
 Genre in the twentyfirst century 

Since the Romantic period modern genre theory often sought to dispense with the conventions that have marked the categorization of genres for centuries However the twentyfirst century has brought a new era in which genre has lost much of the negative connotations associating it with loss of individuality or excess conformity
Genres


Genre categorizes literary works based on specific shared conventions including style mood length and organizational features These genres are in turn divided into subgenres

Western literature is typically subdivided into the classic three forms of Ancient Greece poetry drama and prose Poetry may then be subdivided into the genres of lyric poetry
The standard division of drama into tragedy and comedy derives from Greek drama This division into subgenres can continue: comedy has its own subgenres including for example  comedy of manners sentimental comedy Burlesque
The genre of semifiction includes works that mix elements of both fiction and nonfiction A semifictional work may be the retelling of a true story with only the names changed; at the other end of the spectrum it may present fictional events with a semifictional protagonist as in Jerry Seinfeld (character)
Often the criteria used to divide up works into genres are not consistent and can be subject to debate change and challenge by both authors and critics However some basic distinctions are widely accepted For example it is commonly accepted that the genre of fiction ("literature created from the imagination not presented as fact though it may be based on a true story or situation") is not applied to all fictitious literature but instead encompasses only prose texts (novels novellas short stories) and not fables

Common genres in Western literature
 The genre of Poetry includes the subgenres of sonnets haiku and limerick (poetry) The genre of Prose includes the notebook novel novella and short story
