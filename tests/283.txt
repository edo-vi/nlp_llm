 To raise awareness of Racism in the United States Freedom of speech


Beginning in August 2016 some American athletes have protested against a variety of perceived Injustice
The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat and later knelt during the anthem before his teams National Football League preseason
 Background 

It is a tradition in the United States to play "The StarSpangled Banner" the national anthem before sporting events National Football League (NFL) players were not mandated to be on the field for the playing of the national anthem until 2009  In 2016 the NFL stated that "players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the National Anthem"; its game operations manual reads that players "should stand" for the anthem

The people of the United States are widely divided on the intended meaning of the anthem Some believe it salutes military and police officers who have died on duty; for others it honors the United States generally  The antagonistic response to kneeling is raised in spite of the fact that kneeling is a demonstration of reverence submissiveness and deference in contrast with the interpretation that kneeling is offensive to those who are honored by the anthem  But the military is involved in the playing of the anthem  Teams across all major sports received $68 million from the United States Department of Defense
Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate Eric Reid (American football)</ref>

Kaepernick has said on numerous occasions that the sole purpose of kneeling during the national anthem is not to disrespect the military personnel at all but rather that his goal is to use his social platform to bring topics regarding police brutality and oppression of people of color to light "I am not going to get up to show pride in a country that oppresses black people and people of color" Kaepernick has expressed his concerns about how his actions have been labeled as "anthem protest" since he considers this to be a diversion strategy from his critics to deviate the discussion from what really matters "I am not protesting the anthem or the nation Im protesting organised brutality To me this is much bigger than football and it would be selfish to look the other way There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder"

After Kaepernick started his campaign to create awareness about excess police brutality towards minorities especially AfricanAmericans commentators have mainly shifted focus to the patriotic aspect of kneeling rather than the meaning behind it; thus weakening Kaepernicks primary goal One political person that players believe completely misinterpreted the act of kneeling was former President Trump since he repeatedly claimed that players are protesting the flag and the national anthem; however players are for the most part protesting the lack of accountability in the judicial system and the way police officers can easily get away with police brutality towards AfricanAmericans

Kaepernick was not able to sign a contract with any NFL team even after he opted out of his contract with the 49ers and became a free agent in 2017 presumably because of his actions of taking a knee Nevertheless even though Kaepernick was no longer on the sideline his movement did not stop but rather gained more participants

After that interview Kaepernick pledged to donate the first $1 million of his $119 million salary from the 2016–2017 season to different organizations that help communities in need He pledged to donate $100000 per month for 10 months to various organizations Days later the San Francisco 49ers matched Kaepernick by pledging $1 million to two organizations addressing racial and social inequality Kaepernick has been following through on his commitment and has donated $900000 (~$ in ) as of September 2017 to groups including Meals on Wheels United We Dream Black Veterans for Social Justice and many others Kaepernick has also held "Know Your Rights" camps for young People of Color
 Trump calls for firing protesting players 

File:Donald Trump with jersey helmet and football of New England PatriotsjpgIn September 2017 at a rally in Huntsville Alabama President Trump said NFL owners should fire players who kneel during the national anthem and encouraged fans to walk out Trump stated he would love to see NFL owners say "get that son of a bitch off the field right now out hes fired Hes fired!" He called the players protest "a total disrespect of our heritage" Trump added on that the new NFL safety rules created to protect players from Concussions in American football
Trump said his criticism of the protesters was not related to race "This has to do with respect for our country and respect for our flag" he said In the games immediately following Trumps statements the protest gained broader participation when over 200 players sat or knelt during the anthem others linked arms with their teammates or raised fists and three teams chose to stay in the locker room for the anthem However the response quickly turned into one towards Trump rather than Kaepernicks original protests of racial injustice which took away largely from Kaepernicks original message Reasons cited by players owners and coaches included supporting freedom of speech and opposing what they considered intimidation by Trump The reaction to Trumps remarks were amidst other ongoing issues his administration was facing including failed American Health Care Act of 2017
Many players beyond the 2017 season have knelt or raised fists in protest against Trumps policies Rubio has also expressed his feeling about Kaepernick and while he publicly stated that he does not agree with what Kaepernick does (taking a knee during the national anthem) he does support his rights that allows him to do so and he believes that the NFL should not prohibit him from playing in the league again

2018 preseason

NFL ratings have been in decline for the past couple years except for the 2018 season which saw an increase of 4% However during the 2016 and 2017 seasons ratings were down by 8% and 97% respectively A UBS securities analysis show that the primary cause of the drop in the ratings from the NFL is mainly due to players protesting the national anthem According to the same survey 50% of the decline in rating in 2017 is because of players taking a knee before the game whereas this action only accounts for 18% of the decline of rating in 2016 The decline in ratings also had an impact on the ad revenue from major television companies especially CBS and Fox

Due to Kaepernicks 2018 advertisement with Nike both plaudits and denunciations have been voiced On September 5 2018 in response to the new KaepernickNike campaign the National Black Police Association provided a letter stating "The NBPA believes that Mr Kaepernicks stance is in direct alignment with what law enforcement stands for — the protection of a people their human rights their dignity their safety and their rights as American citizens" Despite being police officers the NBPA defends Kaepernicks actions because they feel that the issue of race must be addressed in order to tackle the ongoing issue<ref>

 NFL national anthem policy 
The previous national anthem policy by the NFL written about a decade before the new policy in May 2018 contained vocabulary that allotted more leeway in the players behavior during the national anthem before games It required players to be on the sideline but only stated that players should not must stand during the national anthem Colin Kaepernick used this fact to an advantage and conducted his act of a peaceful protest which remained inconspicuous until President Trump posted his tweets on Twitter The tweets brought enormous amounts of media attention to the participating players and found people on two sides of the issue; one group that supported Kaepernick and many other players that were protesting to bring awareness to the police brutality that black people faced and the other group that believed kneeling was disrespectful to the country flag or the military

To address the backlash the NFL released a national anthem policy in May 2018 stating that players and team personnel were required to stand during the national anthem Those who chose not to stand were required to remain in the locker room Though NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the vote was unanimous among all NFL owners Jed York the owner of the San Francisco 49ers and Kaepernicks previous team said he abstained During an interview President Trump said that the NFL did "the right thing" of releasing the new policy He added "You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldnt be playing You shouldnt be there Maybe you shouldnt be in the country" In another interview he applauded the new policy after its release but felt that it was not strict enough
