Bioelectromagnetics also known as bioelectromagnetism is the study of the interaction between electromagnetic fields and biological entities. Areas of study include electromagnetic fields produced by living cell (biology)
Biological phenomena

Bioelectromagnetism is studied primarily through the techniques of electrophysiology. In the late eighteenth century the Italy
Several animals are suspected to have the ability to sense electromagnetic fields; for example several aquatic animals have structures potentially capable of sensing electromagnetic induction

Bioeffects of electromagnetic radiation
Most of the molecules in the human body interact weakly with electromagnetic fields in the radio frequency or extremely low frequency bands. One such interaction is absorption of energy from the fields which can cause tissue to heat up; more intense fields will produce greater heating. This can lead to biological effects ranging from muscle relaxation (as produced by a diathermy device) to burns.<ref>cite web  
Many behavioral effects at different intensities have been reported from exposure to magnetic fields particularly with pulsed magnetic fields. The specific pulseform used appears to be an important factor for the behavioural effect seen; for example a pulsed magnetic field originally designed for spectroscopic MRI referred to as Low Field Magnetic Stimulation was found to temporarily improve patient-reported mood in bipolar patients while another MRI pulse had no effect. A whole-body exposure to a pulsed magnetic field was found to alter standing balance and pain perception in other studies.

A strong changing magnetic field can induce electrical currents in conductive tissue such as the brain. Since the magnetic field penetrates tissue it can be generated outside of the head to induce currents within causing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These currents depolarize neurons in a selected part of the brain leading to changes in the patterns of neural activity. In repeated pulse TMS therapy or rTMS the presence of incompatible EEG electrodes can result in electrode heating and in severe cases skin burns. A number of scientists and clinicians are attempting to use TMS to replace electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to treat disorders such as severe depression and hallucinations. Instead of one strong electric shock through the head as in ECT a large number of relatively weak pulses are delivered in TMS therapy typically at the rate of about 10 pulses per second. If very strong pulses at a rapid rate are delivered to the brain the induced currents can cause convulsions much like in the original electroconvulsive therapy. Sometimes this is done deliberately in order to treat depression such as in ECT.

Effects of electromagnetic radiation on human health
While health effects from extremely low frequency (ELF) electric and magnetic fields (0 to 300&nbsp;Hz) generated by power lines and radio/microwave frequencies (RF) (10&nbsp;MHz - 300&nbsp;GHz) emitted by radio antennas and wireless networks have been well studied the intermediate range (IR) (300&nbsp;Hz to 10&nbsp;MHz) has been studied far less. Direct effects of low power radiofrequency electromagnetism on human health have been difficult to prove and documented life-threatening effects from radiofrequency electromagnetic fields are limited to high power sources capable of causing significant thermal effects and medical devices such as pacemakers and other electronic implants. However many studies have been conducted with electromagnetic fields to investigate their effects on cell metabolism apoptosis and tumor growth.

Electromagnetic radiation in the intermediate frequency range has found a place in modern medical practice for the treatment of bone healing and for nerve stimulation and regeneration. It is also approved as cancer therapy in form of Tumor Treating Fields using alternating electric fields in the frequency range of 100–300&nbsp;kHz. Since some of these methods involve magnetic fields that invoke electric currents in biological tissues and others only involve electric fields they are strictly speaking electrotherapy
