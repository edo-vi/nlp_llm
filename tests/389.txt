Space ethics astroethics or astrobioethics is a discipline of applied ethics that discusses the Morality
Specific issues of space ethics include space debris mitigation and the Militarisation of space
Astroethical issues are often discussed as elements of broader issues such as general environmental protection and imperialism Astroethics have been described as an emerging discipline gaining in attention a "necessity for astrobiology" and a "true issue for the future of astrobiology"

 Ethical guidelines for space exploration 

 Planetary Protection 


A guiding principle in astroethics is that of Planetary protection
 Precautionary Principle 


The precautionary principle was defined in the 1998 Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle This approach is supposed to guide decisions in the face of a lack of scientific knowledge or consensus on a matter In a 2010 COSPAR workshop at Princeton University 26 experts embraced the precautionary principle and concluded that "further investigations before interference that is likely to be harmful to Earth and other extraterrestrial bodies including extraterrestrial life and the contamination and disturbance of celestial environments" are to be conducted

 Other Astroethical Principles for SETI 
SETI astrobiologist Margaret Race and Methodist theologian Richard Randolph have outlined 4 principles for the search for extraterrestrial life within our solar system:

 Cause no harm to Earth its life or its diverse ecosystems
 Respect the ecosystem on the surveyed celestial body do not irreparably alter it or its evolutionary trajectory
 Follow proper scientific procedures with honesty and integrity during all phases of exploration
 Ensure international participation by all interested parties

 Astroethical Issues 
A wide range of concrete issues is discussed in astroethics Some of them are adumbrated in the following paragraphs

 Space Debris 
Millions of pieces of space debris defunct artificial objects in space are orbiting Earth On average one cataloged piece of space debris falls back onto the planet every day potentially posing a risk to organisms and property In total an estimated 80 tons of space debris reenter Atmosphere of Earth
As of March 2022 there are no legally binding international laws about who is responsible for the extraction of space debris or mandating a reduction of new space debris brought into Earths orbit However List of government space agencies
The moral problem is that those in power (space agencies) can launch material into the Earths orbit for their own gains without being held accountable for it while the general public has to bear the consequences (such as Air pollution
 Satellite surveillance 
Reconnaissance satellite
 Weaponizing space 
In 1967 the Outer Space Treaty was signed spurred by the development of Intercontinental ballistic missile
This treaty has since been called into question multiple times especially by former President of the United States Donald Trump On June 18 2018 Trump announced plans to establish a space force which would constitute a new sixth branch of the United States military He expressed that "When it comes to defending America it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space We must have American dominance in space" On December 20 2019 the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020
This was seen by some as an American contestation of the Outer Space Treaty Viktor Bondarev chair of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security responded by saying that if the US were to go further and withdraw from the 1967 treaty there would be "a tough response aimed at ensuring world security" This is despite Russia itself having a Russian Space Forces
 Private spaceflight and space tourism 
The emergence of space tourism gives rise to a number of ethical concerns Future frequent and largescale landings on celestial bodies like the moon may damage or pollute landing sites and the areas around them While scientific activity in space is benign this cannot be guaranteed for actions by private people If how by what criteria and by whom laws should be made to ensure that space tourism doesnt negatively impact other celestial bodies is a question of astroethics

 Terraforming other celestial bodies 


Terraforming is a controversial astroethical matter Proponents of terraforming like Robert Zubrin argue that humans being the only technologically advanced and intelligent species on Earth have a moral obligation to make other celestial bodies habitable for Earths lifeforms to ensure their survival after the inevitable destruction of our planet The other Ecocentrism
 Ethicality of SETI and METI 

SETI and especially METI (Active SETI) are not uncontroversial and come with their own ethical implications METI has been criticized as incompatible with the precautionary principle because it could reveal the Location of Earth
Concerns regarding the ethicality of METI might be a solution to the Fermi paradox It is proposed that extraterrestrial life forms may abstain from attempting interstellar communication due to the potential danger it may pose to them in line with the precautionary principle 

Other astroethical considerations regarding METI are the lack of legally enforceable protocols about the steps that should be taken once extraterrestrial life is discovered the unpredictability of Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact
 Value of extraterrestrial life 
A further point of contention in the field is whether extraterrestrial life has Intrinsic value (ethics)
