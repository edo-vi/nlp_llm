Infobox Korean name


Kim Gwangsuk (alternative transliteration Kim Kwangsuk ; born 15 February year unknown; 1976 or 1978 theorized) is a North Korean female gymnast who competed in the 1992 Summer Olympics She is known for both her exemplary uneven bars work and for her involvement in one of the most prominent Age controversies in gymnastics
Kim competed in several major international senior meets between 1989 and 1993 including the 1989 and 1991 World Championships the 1990 Asian Games and the 1992 Summer Olympics
Due to her small stature and the fact that the North Korean Gymnastics Federation listed her given age as 15 for three consecutive years questions arose about Kims age and eligibility for senior competition By at least one estimate she was as young as 11 when she competed at the 1989 World Championships While her real age was never ascertained it was discovered that the Federation had submitted inconsistent birth year information for her at least three times at three separate international competitions As a result of the falsification the North Korean womens gymnastics team was banned from the 1993 World Championships

 Gymnastics career 
Kim was trained by coach Kim Chunphi and was appearing on the international competitive circuit as early as 1987 when she performed at the Junior Friendship Tournament (Druzhba) winning a bronze medal on the uneven bars She continued on to other international meets at both the junior and senior levels including the 1988 Cottbus Cup part of the World Cup circuit where she placed a modest 17th in the allaround and that years Druzhba meet where she once again placed third on bars and won an additional bronze with the North Korean team

The following year 1989 Kim participated in the 1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships
Kims efforts were finally rewarded at the 1991 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships
 Age falsification scandal 
While the gymnastics community praised Kims performances they also questioned her age: Kim was tiny even by gymnastics standards and many people believed she was too young for senior competition

At the 1991 Worlds television commentators made several remarks about Kims supposed age of 15 When Kim appeared at the Olympics the following year with missing front teeth standing 44" weighing 62 pounds and claiming to be 17 years old the skepticism grew with several officials and coaches publicly voicing their doubts to the point where NBC mentioned the controversy in their television broadcasts to American audiences

It was eventually discovered that North Korean officials had falsified Kims birth year at least three occasions supplying different information at different competitions The forgeries had been inconsistent at best as Kims age was given as 15 for three consecutive years but at the Barcelona Olympics in July 1992 her age jumped to 17 By at least one estimate she was no older than 11 or 12 when she competed at the 1989 World Championships and at the team portion of the 1992 Olympics Béla Károlyi suggested she may have been as young as 10 at the time: he remarked "Her baby teeth
The FIG punished the North Korean gymnastics federation by barring their womens team from competing at the 1993 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships
The same year her countrys government honored her by including her in a series of postage stamps commemorating North Korean world champion athletes

As of 2018 Kims real age has never been conclusively determined and is left blank in her FIG profile Birth years given by the North Korean Federation ranged from 1974 to 1976 and late 1990s reports by the Korean News Service claimed that she was 14 years old in both 1989 and 1991

Some people believe Kim was born in 1976 but the more accepted consensus is that her birth year was actually 1978 or even 1979 The rationale behind this estimate is that the North Korean Federation was still supplying inconsistent birth dates for Kim in 1991 and 1992: if she had been born in 1976 or 1977 this would not have been necessary as she would have been properly ageeligible for these events

Little is known about Kim apart from her competitive history In April 2008 she briefly appeared in public in Pyongyang as a torchbearer during the North Korean portion of the Olympic torch relay
