Vaccineinduced seropositivity (VISP) is the phenomenon wherein a person who has received a vaccine against a disease would thereafter give a positive or reactive test result for having that disease when tested for it despite not actually having the disease  This happens because many vaccines encourage the body to produce antibodies against a particular disease and blood tests often determine whether a person has those antibodies regardless of whether they came from the infection or just a vaccination

VISP is especially a concern in vaccine trials for HIV vaccine research because people who give a positive result in an HIV test even if that result is because of a vaccine and not because of an infection may face Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS
HIV
Background
In 1987 in America the first HIV vaccine was tested HIV vaccines have been tested continually worldwide since then but thus far no one has developed any vaccine which reduces a persons risk of contracting HIV if exposed to that virus

Many HIV tests work not by checking a persons blood for HIV but rather by determining whether the bodys own antibodies against HIV are present in the blood  Most HIV vaccines are designed with the intent to promote the bodys own production of antibodies which would combat HIV  Regardless of whether they are effective at stimulating the production of antibodies which fight HIV they usually do cause the body to produce antibodies which standard HIV tests recognize as the antibodies which an HIV positive person would produce in response to HIV infection

A person who is HIV negative and has received an HIV vaccine and who then tests as positive in an HIV test is said to be positive because of VISP

Significance
When an HIVnegative person exhibits VISP and gets an HIVpositive result from a test then that person may have difficulty blood donation
Between 1987 and 2003 the number of persons who received experimental HIV vaccinations was about 10000 and this number was considered small  The difficulties in determining the difference between antibodies produced by HIV infection and vaccineinduced antibodies were managed by individual vaccine research sites who had special capability to conduct additional laboratory testing on this small pool of vaccine recipients  However at this time two new studies the STEP Study in the US and the RV 144 study in Thailand greatly increased the number of people who received HIV vaccinations by another 4600 people There came to be an increased need to raise awareness of VISP because more people were exhibiting it

At the XVIII International AIDS Conference 2010
HIV VISP in developing countries
HIV vaccine research happens worldwide to ensure that any vaccine which researchers develop could be used for people worldwide  In developing countries with limited access to healthcare the problems associated with VISP are a special concern

Researchers from Africa Asia North America and South America have said that getting local government and media support of the research is essential in addition to creating facilities for distinguishing between HIV positive individuals and individuals exhibiting VISP

Likelihood
People who participate in vaccine trials which test HIV vaccines may exhibit VISP for years or for the rest of their lives

A study done on participants in the HIV Vaccine Trials Network HIV vaccination studies showed that among 2176 HIV negative participants who received a vaccine 908 (42%) had VISP  However the occurrence of VISP varied depending on what kind of vaccine the participants received

Hepatitis B
When a person gets a hepatitis B vaccine then the most common test for hepatitis B will show them to be positive  The usual course of action in this case is to give the person a panel of tests for HBsAg antiHBc and antiHBs (hepatitis B surface antigen antihepatitis B core and antihepatitis B surface)  A person who has never been exposed to hepatitis B but has gotten the vaccine will be positive for antiHBs but negative for the other two tests in the panel  Other combinations of positive and negative in this test can mean other things such as acute chronic or past infection

Other conditions
VISP is not often a practical concern for other diseases because in most cases good vaccines already exist and most people who have access to healthcare receive them Also physicians do not routinely test people for recent infections with most diseases as they do for HIV Medical literature on VISP for most diseases is not widely available because there is little practical need for doing that research
