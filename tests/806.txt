Choosing Wisely is a United Statesbased health educational campaign led by the ABIM Foundation (American Board of Internal Medicine) about unnecessary health care

The campaign identifies over 500 tests and procedures and encourages doctors and patients to discuss research and possibly get second opinions before proceeding with them To conduct the campaign the ABIM Foundation asks Specialty (medicine)
The campaign has garnered both praise and criticism and some of its ideas have spread to other countries It does not include evaluation of its effects on costs on discussions or on medical outcomes Some doctors have said they lack time for the recommended discussions

History
File:Christine Cassel describes Choosing Wisely campaignogvIn 2002 the ABIM Foundation published Medical professionalism in the new millennium: a Physician Charter The charter states that physicians have a responsibility to promote health equity when some health resources are scarcity
Continuing this project Choosing Wisely was created to organise the creation of more "lists of five" later ten Executive boards of societies with or without participation by members identify practices which their field may overuse Each recommendation in the program must have the support of clinical guidelines evidence or expert opinion

To participate in Choosing Wisely each society developed list of tests treatments or services which that specialty commonly overuses

As of April 2018 there were 552 recommendations targeting a range of procedures to either question or avoid without special consideration They can be searched online by key words such as "back pain" but the numerous supporting footnotes on each recommendation are only in a pdf on the clinician page without links to the papers

Examples
Some examples of the information shared in Choosing Wisely include the following:
 Acknowledge that physicians are increasing their use of diagnostic procedures without a proportional increase in patient benefits ( improved outcomes) Consider the effects of overuse of diagnostic services<ref>
 
 </ref>
 Physicians overuse radiography services In many cases this fails to improve patient outcomes This also subjects patients to unnecessary ionizing radiation and the possibility of further unnecessary testing<ref>
 
 </ref>
 Before the 39th week of pregnancy doctors should not perform a Caesarean section or Labor induction
Challenges
The Choosing Wisely campaign identifies the following difficulties in achieving its goals:
 In communicating with patients a major challenge in the campaign is the problem inherent in patientcentered care of giving patients some basis for understanding how to make decisions about their health care Many recommendations in the campaign require clinical education to understand fully Also many patients tend to follow the recommendations of their physicians without question even if they have questions
 The United States medical system is based on a feeforservice model in which doctors are paid on the basis of work they do so they are paid for procedures they do though not tests or procedures which they refer to others This system creates incentives for doctors to provide additional treatments rather than exercising evidencebased restraint
 Critics tend to view efforts to reduce medical services as "healthcare rationing in the United States"<ref>
 
 
 </ref> Doctors say that they often feel pressure to engage in defensive medicine by conducting extra testing to avoid lawsuits<ref>
 
 
 </ref>
 The motives of professional societies with Choosing Wisely lists has been questioned as societies avoid targeting lowvalue care that generates income for their members and instead target the practice of other health professionals 

Reception
The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) initially formed three independent task forces to evaluate whether to participate; by 2012 all three task forces recommended against participation because the recommendations do not recognize that emergency physicians need extra tests since they do not know the patients do not recognize that emergency physicians need to eliminate every lifethreatening possibility will lead to refusals by insurers to cover items on the lists let other medical societies tell emergency physicians what to do and because the campaign doesnt address tort reform to address defensive testing and the campaign publicizes the items as "unnecessary tests" even though describing them as tests to discuss carefully

In 2012 The New York Times said that the campaign was likely to "alter treatment standards in hospitals and doctors offices nationwide" and one of their opinion writers said that many tests were unnecessary  CBS News said that "the evidence is on the initiatives side" USA Today noted that the campaign was "a rare coordinated effort among multiple medical societies"

While expressing the need for evidencebased healthcare recommendations in 2012 The Economist found the Choosing Wisely recommendations to be weak because they are not enforceable In an editorial published in the Southwest Journal of Pulmonary and Critical Care Richard Robbin and Allen Thomas expressed concern that the campaign could be used by payers to limit options for doctors and patients However they declare the Choosing Wisely recommendations a "welcome start"

Also in 2012 Robert Goldberg writing for The American Spectator criticized the program saying that it was "designed to sustain the rationale and ideology that shaped Obamacare" (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) that the lists were "redundant and highly subjective" and that participants in the effort would greedily benefit at the expense of others if the campaign succeeded

In February 2013 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation provided USD $25 million in funding for the campaign saying that the foundation wanted to "help increase the tangible impact of the Choosing Wisely campaign"

A 2013 editorial in the journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology reviewed the recommendations and recommended that something similar be proposed by the society; the piece did criticize the overly didactic nature of the recommendations comparing them to the Ten Commandments and expressed concern about whether they adequately addressed the difficulties of assessing risks for each patient  In 2013 critics in the Southwest Journal of Pulmonary & Critical Care said "the present Choosing Wisely campaign has fundamental flaws—not because it is medically wrong but because it attempts to replace choice and good judgment with a rigid set of rules that undoubtedly will have many exceptions Based on what we have seen so far we suspect that Choosing Wisely is much more about saving money than improving patient care We also predict it will be used by the unknowing or unscrupulous to further interfere with the doctorpatient relationship"

In 2015 the campaign was criticized by Bob Lanier executive director of a medical specialty society and past president of the Texas Medical Association Foundation who said that the recommendations were compiled by societies executive committees without good evidence and without following standards of practice or research will lead to refusals by insurers to cover items on the lists are biased against diagnostic testing are an effort by supporters of singlepayer healthcare to reduce costs so that singlepayer healthcare becomes affordable will encourage biased studies by authors funded by insurers and health delivery systems to cut their costs and were influenced by grants available from the ABIM Foundation

In 2015 a piece in Newsweek by Kurt Eichenwald described a controversy around the ABIM Foundations lack of transparency about its finances and functioning

In 2016 campaign was described as an attempt to encourage doctors and patients to recognize the illusion of control or "therapeutic illusion" in choices to use treatments which have a basis outside of evidencebased medicine

In 2017 addiction specialists in Canada said the recommendation to wait for sobriety before treating depression was harmful and unjustified

A 2017 study reported that many patients and physicians found it challenging to use Choosing Wisely recommendations particularly when the patient had symptoms and the doctor recommended against a test Barriers "included malpractice concern patient requests for services lack of time for shared decision making and the number of tests recommended by specialists Cedars–Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles put 100 of the 552 Choosing Wisely items in its electronic medical records These give warnings to doctors but only after they have finished talking to patients and order a procedure or drug so too late to have the recommended discussion

Impact
The Choosing Wisely campaign makes no provision to scientifically research its own efficacy but academic centers are making plans to independently report on the impact of the campaign The services targeted by the Choosing Wisely lists have broad variance in how much impact they can have on patients care and costs Doctors analyzed many services listed as low value by Choosing Wisely and other sources and found that 25% or 42% of Medicare patients received at least one of these services in an average year depending on definitions The services represented 06% or 27% of Medicare costs
and there was no significant pattern among types of physicians

The campaign has been cited as being part of a broader movement including many comparable campaigns The German Network for Evidence Based Medicine considered adapting concepts from the program into the Healthcare in Germany
