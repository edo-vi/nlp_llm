Direct development is a concept in biology.  It refers to forms of growth to adulthood that do not involve metamorphosis.  An animal undergoes direct development if the immature organism resembles a small adult rather than having a distinct larval form.  A frog that hatches out of its egg as a small frog undergoes direct development.  A frog that hatches out of its egg as a tadpole does not.

Direct development is the opposite of complete metamorphosis.  An animal undergoes complete metamorphosis if it becomes a non-moving thing for example a pupa in a Cocoon (silk)
Examples

*Most frogs in the genus Callulina hatch out of their eggs as froglets.
*Springtails and mayflies called ametabolous insects undergo direct development.
