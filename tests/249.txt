File:MetzeraljpgA truncated upland truncated highland or bevelled upland () is the heavily eroded remains of a fold mountain range often from an early period in earth history The term Rumpfgebirge ("rump mountains") was first introduced into the literature in 1886 by Ferdinand von Richthofen The rumps of the former mountain ranges may be found in many lowland regions of the Earths crust (where they form the socalled basement rocks) and especially outcrop in Central Europe through more recent tectonics This could result in an uplifted peneplain which is one type of truncated upland

The valley structures of truncated uplands are often more irregular than in the younger fold mountains which is due to the considerably younger tectonic processes and stronger  erosion (geology)
 Examples 

In western Europe many of the Central Upland ranges fall into the category of truncated uplands â€“ for example the Harz the Ore Mountains the Fichtel Mountains and the Rhenish Massif Other ranges also date to the time of the Variscan orogeny including those on either side of the Rhine such as the Black Forest and Vosges and from the Bavarian Forest in northeast Bavaria through the Bohemian Forest in the Czech Republic to the Bohemian Massif in Austria and the Czech Republic not to mention the French Massif Central This mountain formation took place in the Middle Palaeozoic during the Devonian and Carboniferous epochs about 350 to 250 million years ago Already by the Permian the Variscan mountains had been eroded into the socalled Permian peneplain and overlain by sedimentary rock
The erosion of the mountains exposed numerous mineral resources eg silver and iron ore in the Harz as well as copper (the Rammelsberg is a type locality (geology)
Even older are the Caledonian orogeny
In North America the almost 3000kilometrelong mountain chain of the Appalachians is one of the largest areas of truncated highland in the world It extends in widths of 200 to 300 kilometre from the Southern United States
The Urals between eastern Europe and Siberia have a similar importance in terms of mining and the economy; and the extent of these mountains in Russia which are up to 1900 metres high is similar to that of the Appalachians
