Geologists have been employed since the Napoleonic Wars to provide an analysis of terrain which was expected to become a war theater both in case of an upcoming battle and to assess the difficulty of logistical supply Academically it has been found that battles are likely to occur on rocks of Permian Triassic or Upper Carboniferous age possibly due to their typical relief and drainage More practically geology has been used in identifying the best Allies of World War II
In the Korean Demilitarized Zone
This field partially overlaps with military geography For this reason the British Army employed geographers in this role until the end of 1941 when it joined international common practice and started using geologists

 Geotechnical engineering 

Geologists have been involved in the construction of Fortification
Geology is also used in determining the likely resistance of enemy defenses to shelling and bombing In World War II this task was performed by the Allies as they advanced across Germanoccupied Europe assessing the likely effect of bombing bridges and shelling defenses in light of the local geology

 Resource acquisition 
Geologists are used to determine both the location and accessibility of Strategy
 Forensics 

Geology has been used in many military intelligence investigations During World War II the American Military Geology Unit discovered the origin of FuGo balloon bomb
 Effect of warfare on rocks
Military activity affects the physical geology This was first noted through the intensive shelling on the Western Front during World War I which caused the shattering of the bedrock and changed the rocks permeability New minerals rocks and Sedan Crater
 Discoveries by military 
Military research has led to many geological discoveries; however secrecy has often delayed some of the possible progress The AustroHungarian Army
