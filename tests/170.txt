The nonprofit Evidencebased Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC) comprises a group of scientists and experts with ties to governmental and nongovernmental agencies chemical and pharmaceutical companies and academia that have banded together to promote the use of what are known as "evidencebased approaches" in toxicology  The discipline of evidencebased toxicology (EBT) is a process for transparently consistently and objectively assessing available scientific evidence in order to answer questions in toxicology  EBT has the potential to address concerns in the toxicological community about the limitations of current approaches
The evidencebased methods and approaches now being proposed for toxicology are widely used in medicine which is the basis for their nomenclature  The need to improve how the performance of toxicological test methods is assessed was the main impetus for translating these tools to toxicology

 Goals and benefits 
The EBTCs overall goals are to bring together the international toxicology community to facilitate uses of evidencebased toxicology to inform regulatory environmental and public health decisions  The group aims for improving the public health outcomes and reduce human impact on the environment by bringing evidencebased approaches to safety sciences  The organizations members envision that as these efforts succeed all interested partiesincluding stakeholders in government industry academia and the general publicshould have confidence and trust in the process by which scientific evidence is assessed when addressing questions related to the safety of chemicals to human health and the environment  All individuals affiliated with the organization are volunteers except those serving in the organisations secretariat which is sponsored by the Johns Hopkins Universitys Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT)

The EBTCs members stress that evidence has always been used in toxicology  The evidencebased approach that the collaboration is championing have been used in medicine for decades  Evidencebased medicine (EBM) is a widely respected discipline and it has strengthened the scientific foundation of decisionmaking in clinical medicine by providing a structured way of assessing the evidence bearing on healthcare questions

The EBTC foresees that the evidencebased approach will provide similar benefits to toxicology especially at a time when remarkable advances in biochemistry and molecular biology are enhancing scientists’ ability to understand the nature and mechanisms of the adverse effects that can be caused by chemicals

 Origins 

The EBTC builds upon the outcomes of the First International Forum Toward Evidencebased Toxicology held in Cernobbio/Como Italy on October 15–18 2007  The forum was motivated by increasing concerns in the scientific community about the limitations of toxicological decisionmaking

EBT was next a major topic of discussion at a 2010 workshop held at Johns Hopkins University on 21st century validation for 21st century methods  The enthusiasm for EBT at this workshop inspired the EBTCs formation with an inaugural conference on March 10 2011 as a satellite to the 50th annual Society of Toxicology meeting in Washington DC  At the workshop speakers presented the concept of EBT as it pertains to decisionmaking about the utility of new toxicity tests and their implementation into the risk assessment process

 Tools 

The EBTC is translating the tools used in evidencebased medicine (EBM) to toxicology as well as developing new approaches to respond to the challenges presented by the discipline of toxicology Scientists have made progress in their efforts to apply systematic reviews to evaluate the evidence for associations between environmental toxicants and human health risks  To date researchers have shown that important elements of the systematic review methodology established in evidencebased medicine can be adopted into EBT and a limited number of such studies have been attempted  EBTC scientists are promoting and conducting systematic reviews of toxicological test methods

 Organization 

The EBTC is governed by a board of trustees that has the fundamental responsibilities to provide strategic and fiduciary oversight and direction In addition the Scientific Advisory Council has been established to provide the expertise needed to develop the new EBT methods to conduct specific projects and to advise the Board and the EBTC Director on new areas of research and other scientific issues of relevance to the broader toxicology community  The organization also has working groups charged with producing guidance documents tailored to toxicology on conducting systematic reviews and their components  Working groups are also focused on the application of evidencebased tools to various toxicological practices

Scientists affiliated with the EBTC are conducting pilot studies to demonstrate the value of evidencebased approaches for helping researchers evaluate new laboratory tools and tests for assessing chemical toxicity
