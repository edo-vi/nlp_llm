A vaccine adverse event (VAE) sometimes referred to as a vaccine injury is an adverse event caused by vaccination The World Health Organization (WHO) knows VAEs as Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)

AEFIs can be related to the vaccine itself (product or quality defects) to the vaccination process (administration error or stress related reactions) or can occur independently from vaccination (coincidental)

Most vaccine adverse events are mild Serious injuries and deaths caused by vaccines are very rare and the idea that severe events are common has been classed as a "common misconception about immunization" by the WHO Some claimed vaccine injuries are not in fact caused by vaccines; for example there is a subculture of advocates who Vaccines and autism
Claims of vaccine injuries appeared in litigation in the United States in the latter part of the 20th century Some families have won substantial awards from sympathetic juries even though many public health officials have said that the claims of injuries are unfounded In response several vaccine makers stopped production threatening public health resulting in laws being passed to shield makers from Legal liability
Adverse events

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while "any vaccine can cause side effects" most side effects are minor primarily including sore arms or a mild fever

As the success of immunization programs increases and the incidence of disease decreases public attention shifts away from the risks of disease to the risk of vaccination Concerns about immunization safety often follow a pattern First some investigators suggest that a medical condition of increasing prevalence or unknown cause is due to an adverse effect of vaccination The initial study and subsequent studies by the same investigators have inadequate methodology typically a poorly controlled or uncontrolled case series A premature announcement is made of the alleged adverse effect which resonates with individuals who have the condition and which underestimates the potential harm of not being vaccinated The initial study is not reproduced by other investigators Finally it takes several years before the public regains confidence in the vaccine

Controversies in this area revolve around the question of whether the risks of adverse events following immunization outweigh the benefits of preventing infectious disease In rare cases immunizations can cause serious adverse effects such as gelatin measlesmumpsrubella vaccine (MMR) causing anaphylaxis a severe allergic reaction Allegations particularly focus on disorders claimed to be caused by the MMR vaccine controversy
The debate is complicated by misconceptions around the recording and reporting of adverse events by antivaccination activists According to authorities antivaccination websites greatly exaggerate the risk of serious adverse effects from vaccines and falsely describe conditions such as autism and shaken baby syndrome as vaccine injuries leading to misconceptions about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines This has had the result of stigmatizing autistic people and the parents who had them immunized

Many countries including Canada Germany Japan and the United States have specific requirements for reporting vaccinerelated adverse effects while other countries including Australia France and the United Kingdom include vaccines under their general requirements for reporting injuries associated with medical treatments A number of countries have programs for the compensation of injuries alleged to have been caused by a vaccination

United States

Vaccine Injury Compensation Program

In 1988 the Vaccine court
VICP uses a streamlined system for litigating vaccine injury claims under which the claimant must show that the vaccine caused the injury but just as in litigation for injury by any other product they are not required to establish it was anyones fault (ie negligence need not be proven) Claims that are denied can be pursued through civil lawsuits though this is rare and the statute creating the VICP also imposes substantial limitations on the ability to pursue such lawsuits The VICP covers all vaccines listed on the Vaccine Injury Table

In addition an award may only be given if the claimants injury lasted for more than 6 months after the vaccine was given resulted in a hospital stay and surgery or resulted in death Awards are based on medical expenses lost earnings and pain and suffering (capped at $250000)

From 1988 until March 3 2011 5636 claims relating to autism and 8119 nonautism claims were made to the VICP 2620 of these claims one autismrelated were compensated with 4463 nonautism and 814 autism claims dismissed; awards (including attorneys fees) totaled over $2 billion The VICP also applies to claims for injuries sustained before 1988; there were 4264 of these claims of which 1189 were compensated with awards totaling $903 million As of October 2019 $42 billion in compensation (not including attorneys fees and costs) has been awarded over the life of the program

As part of NVICP a table has been created which lists various vaccines side effects that might plausibly be caused by them and the time within which the symptoms must present in order to be eligible to apply for compensation For example for vaccines containing tetanus toxoid (eg DTaP DTP DT Td or TT) anaphylaxis within four hours or brachial neuritis between two and twentyeight days after administration may be compensated

Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a passive surveillance program administered jointly by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

VAERS is intended to track adverse events associated with vaccines VAERS collects and analyzes information from reports of adverse events that occur after the administration of US licensed vaccines VAERS has several limitations including underreporting unverified reports inconsistent data quality and inadequate data about the number of people vaccinated Due to the programs open and accessible design and its allowance of unverified reports incomplete VAERS data is often used in false claims regarding vaccine safety

Vaccine Safety Datalink

The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) funded by the Centers for Disease Control is composed of databases from several organizations containing information regarding health outcomes for millions of US citizens and to enhance assessment of vaccine injuries  It was designed to allow for such things as comparisons between vaccinated and nonvaccinated populations and for the identification of possible groups at risk for adverse events

United Kingdom

The Vaccine Damage Payment Act 1979 governs AEFIs in the UK and sets up the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS)

Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme
Under the VDPS it is thought that thousands of unsuccessful claims have been made  The maximum payment per claim is currently £120000  The disability threshold  before payments are granted is 60%  The scheme covers vaccinations for illnesses such as tetanus measles tuberculosis and meningitis C  As of 2005 the British government had paid out £35 million to vaccine injury patients since 1997

Until the advent of COVID19 disabled vaccine injury patients were allowed to file a claim up to the age of 21  On the 2 December 2020 government agreed under regulation secondary to the 1979 Act the statutory £120000 blanket payout for any person provably damaged by the vaccine and by the same addition of COVID19 to the list governmentapproved Covax manufacturers were exempted from legal pursuit Individuals who provide the vaccine (and thus are permitted by government to do so) are also protected

Canada
Quebec has a legal process to compensate certain forms of vaccination injuries; the program was set up by statute in 1985

On 10 December 2020 the nations was made aware via an oped published in the Globe and Mail that "Canada needs to prepare for rare but serious health problems resulting from Covid19 vaccination" by inter alia the Honourable Dr Jane Philpott former cabinet member and Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences of Queens University at Kingston

The authors conclude that an "equitable and fair compensation system with a transparent accountability process for monitoring potential AEFIs associated with COVID19 immunization could increase public confidence in vaccines and promote uptake"

Germany has established a treatment and research centre for VAEs at University Hospital of Giessen and Marburg
