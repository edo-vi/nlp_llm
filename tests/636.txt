 Execution 
The technique has many variants  The general prescription is to disengage and exaggerate the diagnosed somatic dysfunction This is the indirect component The practitioner then waits for a change in the palpatory quality of the structure being treated ie a change in skin tension temperature or muscle tension This is followed by a balancing stage in which the practitioner slowly brings the joint into the diagnosed restriction (the direct component)
