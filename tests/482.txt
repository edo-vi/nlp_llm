Since the 1960s the issue of Native Americans in the United States
In response since the 1970s an increasing number of secondary schools have retired such Native American names and mascots Changes accelerated in 2020 following public awareness of institutional racism prompted by nationally covered cases of police misconduct National attention was focused on the prominent use of names and images by professional franchises including the Washington Commanders (Redskins until July 2020) and the Cleveland Guardians (Indians until November 2021) In Canada the Edmonton Eskimos became the Edmonton Elks in 2021 Each such change at the professional level has been followed by changes of school teams; for instance 29 changed their names between August and December 2020 A National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) database tracks some 1900 K12 schools in 970 school districts with Native “themed” school mascots

The issue has often been reported in the media only in terms of Native American individuals being affected by the offensiveness of certain terms images and performances This reduces the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions It prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate such practices Social science research has shown that sports mascots and images are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects in society A 2020 analysis of this research indicates only negative effects; those psychologically detrimental to Native American students and to nonNative persons by promoting negative stereotypes and prejudicial ideas of Native Americans and undermining intergroup relations Based on such research showing negative effects more than 115 professional organizations representing civil rights educational athletic and scientific experts have adopted resolutions stating that such use of Native American names and symbols by nonnative sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping; it promotes misunderstanding and prejudice that contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans

Defenders of mascots often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits such as fighting spirit and being strong brave stoic dedicated and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages In general the social sciences recognize that all ethnic stereotypes whether positive or negative are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute fostering a disrespectful relationship The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups thus mascots are considered morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals Defenders of the status quo also state that the issue is not important being only about sports and that the opposition is nothing more than "political correctness" which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias

The NCAI and over 1500 national Native organizations and advocates have called for a ban on all Native imagery names and other appropriation of Native culture in sports The joint letter included over 100 Nativeled organizations as well as tribal leaders and members of over 150 federally recognized tribes reflecting their consensus that Native mascots are harmful Use of such imagery and terms has declined but at all levels of American and Canadian sports it remains fairly common Former Representative Deb Haaland (DNew Mexico) approved in March 2021 as the first Indigenous United States Secretary of the Interior
History
European Americans have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back to the Colonial history of the United States
Professional team names had similar origins In professional baseball the team that is now the Atlanta Braves was founded as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871; becoming the History of the Boston Braves
The Cleveland Guardians
The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest forced relocation and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures The governmentsponsored Native American boarding schools<blockquote>Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes misconceptions and caricatures Whether portrayed as noble savages Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America

Native American


In the 1940s the NCAI created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media Over time the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the Braves and the Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people and demean their traditions and rituals "Often citing a longheld myth by nonNative people that "Indian" mascots "honor Native people" American sports businesses such as the National Football League
Several of the founders of the American Indian Movement including Clyde Bellecourt Vernon Bellecourt Dennis Banks and Russell Means were among the first to protest team names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989 Cornel Pewewardy (ComancheKiowa) Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University cites Indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism By placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context this continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism

Native mascots are part of the larger issues of cultural appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights This encompasses all instances when nonnatives use indigenous music art costumes etc in entertainment and commerce Scholars contend that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize assimilate and oppress Indigenous groups The use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots has been characterized as contributing to the Social exclusion
Issues related to misunderstanding of Native American legal status have also arisen in cases of foster care or adoption of Native American children Among these is what is known as the Adoptive Couple v Baby Girl
Not all Native Americans totally oppose mascots Steven Denson (Chickasaw) a professor at Southern Methodist University has said that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner He says: 
<blockquote>I believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the NativeAmerican culture And it must also be done with the support of the NativeAmerican community There is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals</blockquote>

The NCAI has recognized the right of individual tribes to establish relationships with teams that allow the latter to retain tribal names For instance the Spokane Indians a minor league baseball team has established a relationship with the Spokane tribe It has abandoned Native American imagery that it had used when the team was founded in 1903 The logo is an "S" and includes a feather; "Spokane" is written on the team jerseys in SalishSpokaneKalispel language
Social sciences and education

A consensus on the damage caused by the use of Native American mascots was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999:
<blockquote>Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of Indigenous peoples and their cultures When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University) In the same vein we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity</blockquote>

Sports mascots have been cited as an example of Microaggression theory
In 2005 the American Psychological Association (APA) issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots Symbols Images and Personalities by Schools Colleges Universities Athletic Teams and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment the negative effects on the selfesteem of American Indian children and discrimination that may violate civil rights Such use also affects nonnatives: by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes and preventing learning about Native American culture The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs traditions and values of Native Americans In 2021 the New York Association of School Psychologists reiterated the APA position on Native mascots in its position statement advocating the inclusion of Indigenous persons in educational programs regarding diversity

Similar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport the American Sociological Association the American Counseling Association and the American Anthropological Association In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students the National Education Association included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as a recommendation for improvement In 2018 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced it would no longer consider teams with racist mascots such as the Kansas City and Washington football teams for its annual RWJF Sports Award; this recognizes organizations that contribute to public health through sports

Social science research has substantiated the objections by Native Americans to use of such elements In particular studies support the view that sports mascots and images are not trivial Stereotyping directly affects academic performance and selfesteem of Native American students contributing to other issues faced by Native Americans including suicide unemployment and poverty European Americans exposed to mascots are more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes Two studies examining the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot found a tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group (Asian Americans) which is indicative of a "spreading effect" Exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking; demonstrating the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind A connection between stereotyping and racism of any group increasing the likelihood of stereotyping others was made by Native Americans opposing the "Indians" mascot in Skowhegan Maine when fliers promoting the KKK were distributed in that town

Civil rights

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names images and mascots in 1999

In 2001 the United States Commission on Civil Rights
In a report issued in 2012 a United Nations expert on Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that "obscures understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes" Justice Murray Sinclair the head of Canadas Truth and reconciliation commission
In testimony at a session of the Nebraska Advisory Committee of the US Commission on Civil Rights in December 2020 local Tribal leaders said its time for the 22 schools statewide to review their use of Native American names symbols and images for their mascots The Nebraska School Activities Association which oversees interscholastic sports indicated support for ongoing discussion but that they had no authority to issue statewide mandates regarding mascots University of Nebraska Omaha Professor Edouardo Zendejas a member of the Omaha people
Legal remedies
While all advocates for elimination of Native mascots agree that the practice is morally wrong many do not find a basis for legal remedy based upon violation of civil rights Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by African Americans and Native Americans The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty The appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group in particular African Americans would be unthinkable and the continued claim that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans

In February 2013 the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education
A legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who say they are not offended This raised the difficulty of Native American identity in the United States also an evolving controversy

Religious organizations

In 1992 the Central Conference of American Rabbis issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins In 2001 the Unitarian UniversalismQuote box
   

In 2013 group of sixtyone religious leaders in Washington DC sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Redskins owner Daniel Snyder stating their moral obligation to join the "Change the Mascot" movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended

Members of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Quakers</ref>

In a meeting March 1 2014 the Board of Directors of the Central Atlantic Conference of the United Church of Christ (UCC) unanimously passed a resolution proposing that its members boycott Washington Redskins games and shun products bearing the teams logo until the team changes its name and mascot Redskins spokesman Tony Wyllie offered a response saying "We respect those who disagree with our teams name but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen to the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans including Native Americans who support our name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community" At its annual meeting in June 2014 the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott The resolution and boycott was passed by the National Synod of the UCC in June 2015

Popular opinion
Individuals for whom being American as central to their sense of self the reality of Native oppression (eg genocide police brutality) threatens their positive national identity Native mascots erase and dehumanize Natives and protect that identity<ref>Cite journal 
General public opinion is shifting towards approval of eliminating mascots with a majority of fans and younger people supporting recent changes by professional teams as indicated by an Nielsen poll conducted in March 2021

The topic became an issue on a national level in the twentyfirst century with a hearing before the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011 and a symposium at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in 2013 In November 2015 President Obama speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference stated "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms

Mainstream opinion reflects the function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology There are many benefits associated with sports fandom both private (increased selfesteem) and public (community solidarity) The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team The name mascot cheerleaders and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences In an open letter published in 2013 Daniel Snyder explicitly invoked these associations with family friends and an 81year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name When selfesteem becomes bound to the players and the team there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences including denial or rationalization of misbehavior However for some the identity being expressed is one of supremacy with the defense of native mascots being clearly racist

Some individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful and to pay homage to Native American people Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory Karl Swanson vicepresident of the Washington Redskins professional football team in 2003 declared in the magazine Sports Illustrated that his teams name "symbolizes courage dignity and leadership" and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people"

However many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful Richard Lapchick director emeritus of Northeastern Universitys Center for the Study of Sport in Society in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in Blackface
Others claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance Chief Illiniwek the former mascot for the University of Illinois became the subject of protest in 1988 The Peoria people are the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy In response to requests by those who had portrayed the mascot to bring back occasional performances Peoria Chief John P Froman reaffirmed the tribes position that Chief (Illiniwek) "was not in any way representative of Peoria culture"

Conservative columnists have asserted that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans

Other team names and ethnic groups
Many argue there is a double standard in Native Americans being so frequently used as a sports team name or mascot when the same usage would be unthinkable for other racial or ethnic group One current exception is the Coachella Valley High School "Arabs" which has also been the subject of controversy resulting in the retirement of its more cartoonish representations

Financial impact of change
Many supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would outweigh the benefits Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames generate millions of dollars in sales each year and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping Clyde Bellecourt when director of the American Indian Movement stated: "Its the behavior that accompanies all of this thats offensive The rubber Tomahawk (axe)
A study done by the Emory University Goizueta Business School indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams losing money compared to more popular animal mascots Writing for Forbes in response to the statewide mascot ban passed by Maine in 2019 marketing analyst Henry DeVries compares Native mascots to the retired "Frito Bandito" mascot and argues that "offensive marketing mascots" are a bad idea financially and "on the wrong side of history"

Public opinion surveys

A survey conducted in 2002 by Harris Insights & Analytics
A flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon selfidentification to select the target population In an editorial in the The HeraldTimes
Trends
<!As in the lead section this is a summary of the sections that follow and thus does not include references for each statement>
The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) states that as of 2020 there were 1916 schools in 1025 school districts that use such mascots

While protests began in the 1970s national attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behavior of some fans to the attention of Native Americans The appearance of the Atlanta Braves in the 1991 World Series and the Washington Redskins at the 1992 Super Bowl XXVI
The documents most often cited to justify the elimination of Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005 Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination However the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated

Individual school districts have responded to complaints by local Native American individuals and tribes or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition For example in 2016 when one of the teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo it was immediately changed to the Lake Erie Eagles Little League International updated its 2019 rulebook to include a statement prohibiting "the use of team names mascots nicknames or logos that are racially insensitive derogatory or discriminatory in nature" This decision has been applauded by the National Congress of American Indians In February 2019 US Lacrosse issued a position statement which said in part "As the sports national governing body US Lacrosse believes that the misuse of Native American nicknames logos and mascots reflect and promote misleading stereotypes that are degrading and harmful to Native Americans We will make every effort to assure that offensive or stereotypical mascots and logos will not be visible or promoted at events that US Lacrosse controls"

Legal and administrative action

Laws resolutions or school board decisions regarding team names and mascots have been approved mostly in states with significant Native American populations In 2022 Kansas approved a nonbinding resolution encouraging the elimination of Native mascots within the next five years Other states including California (2015) Colorado (2021) Michigan (2012) Nevada (2021) Oregon (2012) and Washington (2021) These laws allow for exemption for schools gaining approval agreements with local tribes To date Maine is the only state to completely ban Native Americanthemed mascots

The New York State Education Department (NYSED) issued a memo in November 2022 requiring schools with a Native American mascot to find a replacement by the end of the 202223 school year Those schools that fail to do so without current approval from a recognized tribe may be in willful violation of the Dignity for All Students Act The penalties for such a violation include the removal of school officers and the withholding of State Aid

Secondary schools and youth leagues

Secondary schools in both the United States and Canada have displayed a range of actions with some voluntarily changing names or images while others have kept current mascots A 2013 analysis of a database indicated that more than 2000 high schools have mascots that referred to Native American culture Following a period of extended population growth in both countries over 50 years this compares to around 3000 schools with such names at the beginning of that period

Canada
The Department of Educational Foundations at the University of Saskatchewan passed a resolution in 2013 calling for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict First Nations in Canada
In addition to changing their sports mascots school boards in Ontario in 2016 were considering a ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos whether related to professional or local teams

Since the early 21st century the Nepean Redskins Football Club a minor league youth team operating for 35 years in Ottawa Ontario had been asked to change its name In 2013 A Tribe Called Red
In 2017 the Swift Current Indians baseball club changed its name to the Swift Current 57s

United States
The Oregon State Board of Education voted in 2012 to ban Oregon public schools from using Native Americans as mascots An exception was made in 2014 to allow schools to keep their mascots if a local federallyrecognized tribe agreed Schools using a "Warriors" mascot were allowed to keep the name if any Native American imagery was changed Changes made following the policy include The Dalles High School Eagle Indians changing to the "Riverhawks" the Reedsport Community Charter School Braves to the singular "Brave" (as an adjective) and the Mohawk High School (Marcola Oregon)
The city school board in Rutland (city) Vermont
In January 2020 the school board of Killingly High School in Killingly Connecticut
This issue was dealt with differently in Maine where there was also support for changing such offensive names In Skowhegan Maine where the area high school sports team was named the "Indians" the Penobscot Nation and the American Civil Liberties Union
Due to media coverage of the controversy over the prominent Washington Redskins high schools with the sports teams named Redskins have received particular attention across the country Three have a majority of Native American students Advocates for the name suggest that because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves it is not insulting But the principal of Red Mesa High School a Native Americanmajority school in Teec Nos Pos Arizona said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created"

In 2001 the commissioner of the New York State Education Department sent a letter to all New York school boards calling for the elimination of Native American mascots The Seneca Nation Tribal Council responded with support for the Warrior imagery in the Salamanca school Other members of the community also wanted to retain it Some 26% of the Salamanca Central High School students are Native American (primarily Seneca) and its sports teams were called the "Warriors" Since the late 20th century keeping the Warrior sports identity has resulted in negotiations in Salamanca between the Seneca and nonSeneca populations and actions that have raised general awareness of true Seneca culture For example the school logo was changed to accurately depict a Seneca man; this replaced a stereotypical Plains Indian warrior image that had been used prior to 1978

Multiple image

The Port Neches–Groves High School "Indian" mascot has garnered controversy for being racist and culturally insensitive These depictions include the use of the chant "scalping
In 2020 the Cherokee Nation called for the school to discontinue its use of the mascot In March 2022 the schools "Indianettes" drill team chanted the phrase "Scalp Em" during a performance at Walt Disney Worlds Magic Kingdom after being told they would not be allowed to wear their war bonnets Disney released a statement condemning the performance and stating the Indianettes had not been in the schools audition tape In the wake of the controversy the Cherokee Nation renewed its demand that the high school drop the mascot and end its Indianrelated traditions

Also taking place in 2022 was the New York State Education Departments decision to require every school district in the state with Native Americanthemed mascots – or Native Americanthemed team names (such as "Warriors") – to change them unless receiving approval for an exemption from a state or federallyrecognized tribe; any district which does not comply would risk having state funds withheld and administrators being removed Many applauded the decision – including several members of the Shinnecock Indian Nation on Long Island – while many others questioned the purpose and constitutionality of the ban A controversy regarding the ban arose in 2023 when New York state denied the Wyandanch Union Free School District
Colleges and universities

File:Ticket Washington vs Stanford 1930 side1jpgSome college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots Stanford University had "The Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972 Today Stanfords athletic team identity is built around the "Stanford Cardinal" reflecting the primary school colors
Although Dartmouth College had not used an Indian mascot for many years Yale University printed a program for the 2016 game commemorating its 100th game against Dartmouth showing historical program covers featuring depictions of Native Americans that some imagine to be racist

The Florida State Seminoles of Florida State University use names and images associated with the Seminole people The use is officially sanctioned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida even though the NCAA "continues to believe the stereotyping of Native Americans is wrong"

National Collegiate Athletic Association

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to 31 colleges in 2005 for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice Nineteen teams were cited as having potentially "hostile or abusive" names mascots or images that would be banned from displaying them during postseason play and prohibited from hosting tournaments Subsequently all of the colleges previously using Native American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of Tribal sovereignty in the United States
San Diego State University (SDSU) was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants However in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supported removal of the mascot calling its continued use "institutional racism" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity Equity and Outreach A task force of students faculty and alumni was appointed to study the issue and make a recommendation by April 2018 The recommendation was to keep the mascot but take steps to use only respectful references to Aztec culture

In 2008 the NCAA and the University of North Dakota (UND) agreed to retire the universitys Fighting Sioux name unless UND received approval from both the Standing Rock and Spirit Lake Sioux tribes by the end of 2010 The Spirit Lake tribe approved retaining the name but the Standing Rock tribe did not UND selected "Fighting Hawks" as their new nickname in 2015

Professional teams


Current usage
Atlanta Braves

The Atlanta Braves continue to use of the tomahawk chop (although it began at Florida State University) In February 2019 after the removal of the Cleveland Indians Chief Wahoo logo MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said "The Braves have taken steps to take out the tomahawk chop" In October St Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley a member of the Cherokee Nation said that the tomahawk chop and chant misrepresents Native Americans In response to this complaint the Atlanta Braves in their October 9 game against the Cardinals did not provide fans with foam tomahawks although the music accompanying the chant was played while fans performed the arm gesture When the Braves lost to the Cardinals 13–1 the San Francisco Bay Area Fox affiliate used the headline "Braves Scalped" drawing criticism as an example of why most Native Americans oppose the use of American Indian imagery and mascots in sports The station soon apologized The team front office said in 2019 that there would be talks with Native Americans during the offseason regarding the tomahawk chop tradition while leaders of two tribes that once inhabited Georgia the Cherokee and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation agree that the tradition is inappropriate

The continued performance of the tomahawk chop and war chant by Braves fans was made highly visible nationally by the teams appearance in the 2021 World Series The Braves were defended by MLB Commissioner Manfred who referred to the support of the team by Richard Sneed principal chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Other Native American leaders around the country continue to describe "the Chop" and its associated fan behavior as deeply insulting while avoiding direct criticism of Sneed Psychologist Stephanie Fryberg believes personal opinions have little to do with the potential detrimental effects of mascots to Native American youth and communities<ref>

Chicago Blackhawks

File:Brandon Saad  Chicago Blackhawksjpg
Native American rights advocate Suzan Shown Harjo (Cheyenne and Muscogee) said in 2013 that the Chicago Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because Ice hockey
The teams name originates from the nickname applied to the United States Armys 86th Infantry Division (United States)
In 2019 the American Indian Center of Chicago ended all ties to the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation stating they will no longer affiliate "with organizations that perpetuate stereotypes through the use of Indian mascots" The AIC said that they "previously held a relationship with the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation with the intention of educating the general public about American Indians and the use of logos and mascots The AIC along with members of the community have since decided to end this relationship" and stated that "going forward AIC will have no professional ties with the Blackhawks or any other organization that perpetuates harmful stereotypes"

Kansas City Chiefs
File:Patrick Mahomes gets ready to snap the balljpg
In 1963 the Kansas City Chiefs adopted their name when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated "Chiefs" was not a direct reference to Native Americans but to the nickname of Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to Kansas City Missouri  Bartle took his nickname as founder of Tribe of MicOSay a Boy Scouts of America
On August 20 2020 the Chiefs announced that headdresses and Native American–style face paint would be banned at Arrowhead Stadium The ban went into effect during the 2020 season opener on September 10 2020 The tomahawk chop also underwent a subtle modification as Arrowheadbased cheerleaders are now required to lead the chop with a closed fist rather than the traditional open palm While fans said they will not change their behavior a Native activist said that the chop should be eliminated entirely The appearance of the chop in Super Bowl LV focused attention on the Chiefs in 2021 to follow the example set by Washington Cleveland and many high schools A group of two dozen Native Americans from Florida Kansas City and elsewhere protested in front of the stadium on game day Protests by Native Americans at Arrowhead Stadium on game day have increased

Prior usage
Several teams changed when they moved to other cities while others went out of business The Atlanta Hawks were originally the Quad Cities
The United States national rugby league team was known as the Tomahawks until 2015 when USA Rugby League replaced the American National Rugby League as the sports governing body in the US and chose the simpler Hawks as the new name for the team

Cleveland Indians

File:Vizquel96jpgOn March 21 2018 the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown New York enacted a ban on Chief Wahoo being featured on future Hall of Fame plaques Starting in the 2019 season the Chief Wahoo logo did not appear on uniforms nor on stadium signs although it was still licensed for team merchandise within the Cleveland area However merchandise with Chief Wahoos image was removed from the teams website

On July 23 2021 the ball club announced the name would change to the Cleveland Guardians at the end of the 2021 season The new name was selected with reference to the Guardians of Traffic statues that adorn the Hope Memorial Bridge The name change was made official on November 19 2021

Edmonton Eskimos

In part because they did not use any native imagery the Edmonton ElksHowever on July 16 2020 it was reported that the club would drop the Eskimos name On July 21 the team officially retired the name and began using "Edmonton Football Team" and "EE Football Team" until a new name was decided On June 1 2021 the team was renamed to the Edmonton Elks

Golden State Warriors
The Golden State Warriors eliminated Native American imagery as the team relocated Originally the Philadelphia Warriors (1946–1962) their logo was a cartoon Native American dribbling a basketball When they moved to San Francisco the logo became a Native American headdress (1962–1968) The final elimination of Native imagery occurred with the move to Oakland and the change to the current name (1971)

Washington Redskins


File:NotYourMascot2jpgWhile playing as the Washington Redskins the Washington Commanders received the most public attention due to the prominence of the team being located in the Washington DC

Other issues

Stereotyping by rival fans
In addition to the behavior displayed by some fans of the teams with Native American names or mascots their rival fans often invoke racist stereotypes In December of 2013 when the Washington Redskins played the Kansas City Chiefs an employee of a Sonic DriveIn in Missouri placed a message outside that used scalping Indian reservation
Varying degrees of offensiveness
To further complicate this controversy many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending on the name of the team the logo the mascot and the behavior of fans The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting such as the Cleveland Indians Chief Wahoo; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur such as Redskins or Squaws or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures such as the tomahawk chop

The practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy A local example is Washington High School (Sioux Falls South Dakota)
Teams outside North America

Native American names and images are used by teams in other countries generally those playing Americanstyle sports and copying the imagery of American teams Several are in countries that also have a tradition of Native American hobbyism in Germany
