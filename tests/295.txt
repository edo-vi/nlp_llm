A miscellany is a collection of various pieces of writing by different authors Meaning a mixture medley or assortment a wikt:miscellany

Manuscript miscellanies are important in the Middle Ages and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry  Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text mixing poetry with legal documents recipes music medical and devotional literature and other types of text and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany  They may have been written as a collection or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience  In the early modern period miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context both in manuscript and printed forms mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry but also other works  Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the 18th century in literature

The broadest distinction is between manuscript and printed miscellanies Manuscript miscellanies were carefully compiled by hand but also circulated consumed and sometimes added to in this organic state – they were a prominent feature of 16th and early 17th century literary culture Printed miscellanies which evolved in the late 17th and 18th centuries were compiled by editors and published by booksellers to make a profit While manuscript miscellanies were produced by a small coterie of writers and so were constructed around their own personal tastes printed miscellanies were increasingly aimed towards a popular audience and bear the marks of commercially driven money making opportunistic endeavours

Multiauthored collections are known to exist in many forms – such as newspapers magazines or Literary magazine

Verse miscellanies are collections of poems or poetic extracts that vary in authorship genre and subject matter The earlier tradition of manuscript verse continued to be produced in the 16th century and onwards and many of these early examples are preserved in national state and university libraries as well as in private collections The Devonshire MS

Printed verse miscellanies arose in the latter half of the 16th century during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) One of the most influential English Renaissance verse miscellanies was Richard Tottel’s Songes and Sonettes now better known as Tottels Miscellany First printed in 1557 it ran into nine further editions before 1587; it was not then printed again until the 18th century Although few new miscellanies emerged during the insurrectionary years of James VI and I
The poetry in these miscellanies varied widely in List of literary genres
 Development in the 18th century

Throughout the 18th century the miscellany was the customary mode through which popular verse and occasional poetry would be printed circulated and consumed Michael F Suarez one of the leading authorities on miscellanies states:



Including songbooks the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature lists almost 5000 verse miscellanies which were printed between 1701 and 1800 Due to the sheer number and variety of miscellanies printed in the 18th century there are few generalizations that can be made about them From the polite (Allan Ramsay (poet)

 Range of titles and audiences 

In a competitive market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important Without a specific sellingpoint more generic complications would use catchall titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves with a wide range of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes Titles could evoke the ornamental (The Bouquet: or Blossoms of Fancy 1796) the medicinal (The Merry Companion: or A Cure for the Spleen 1730) the festive or feast (A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies 1746) the curious (A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies 1751–82) and the curatorial (The Foundling Hospital for Wit 1743–64)

 Variety and popularity 

Despite these categorizations miscellanies attempted to appeal to a wide audience by containing a variety of material for different tastes Although an editor might orient the miscellany towards an intended audience by nature of the variety of verse a much wider readership would have been possible Oneoff occasional miscellanies might prove popular and warrant further volumes or editions such as political pamphlets (Poems on Affairs of State 1689–1705) resortbased works (Tunbrigalia: or the Tunbridge Miscellany 1712–40) local productions (Ritsons Yorkshire Garland 1809
 Print trade and piracy 

Often the commercial success of a miscellany would stimulate the publication of similarly titled parasitic and even entirely Copyright infringement

 Changing tastes and technology 

Although poetry maintained cultural preeminence for most of the 18th century it was at the same time retreating before the advance of prose and particularly the NovelThe rise of the novel


Miscellanies however remained popular throughout the 19th century especially what came to be known as the “weekly news miscellany which typically appeared at the weekend and featured not only a summary of the week’s intelligence but also a variety of instructive and entertaining matter” in other words what we call today a magazine but poetry was no longer privileged among these publications Verse miscellanies slowly died out in the Victorian era as literary miscellanies made possible the Serial (literature)

 Succession of the anthology 


In the wake of collections such as Robert Anderson (editor and biographer)


Printing technologies and the rise of the novel played an important role in reshaping the nature of miscellanies as did changing ideas about the British literature
 Significance and recognition 

In contrast to Anthology


There are modifications to this definition such as the argument that miscellanies could contain elements that might be considered anthological (the inclusion of Culture of ancient RomeLiterature
 The literary marketplace 

It is generally accepted that miscellanies offer insight into the popular taste of the moment of what people read and how they read it; yet they also provide information about the Aesthetics


Miscellanies frequently placed emphasis on variety novelty and fashionability providing their readers with a range of different pieces by various writers but also keeping them abreast of the newest developments in the literary market They are a prime demonstration of early marketing and advertising techniques in literature

 Contemporary importance and influence 

Miscellanies were an influential literary form at the time From the beginning of the 18th century verse miscellanies were gathering together a selection of poetic works by different authors past and present and so played a part in the development of the concept of the British literature
 Submerged voices and marginal writing 

Because of the variety and novelty they emphasise as well as the anonymity of authorship they could offer miscellanies often enabled the inclusion and so expression of more submerged voices such as those of women and more marginal forms of writing such as the comic the curious and the crude As Dustin Griffin has noted:



Many miscellanies contained exclusively the Womens writing in English
Miscellanies also presented themselves as performing an important cultural or curatorial role by preserving Bookbinding
 Literary criticism and research projects 

It is now widely accepted by literary critics that paying attention to forms of access to literature and to the Reception theory


In light of such developments there have arisen projects attempting to make the vast number and array of verse miscellanies more accessible to modern researchers and readers most prominently through the process of online DigitizingLiterary preservation
