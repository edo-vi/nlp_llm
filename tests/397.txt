An orogenic gold deposit is a type of hydrothermal mineral deposit More than 75% of the gold recovered by humans through history belongs to the class of Orogeny</ref> Rock structure is the primary control of orogenic gold Mineralization (geology)</ref>

 Overview 
Orogenic gold deposits are hosted by shear zones in Orogeny</ref> Formation of orogenic gold deposits is related to structural evolution and structural geometry of Lithosphere
 Historical term 
Waldemar Lindgren made the first widely accepted classification of gold deposits and introduced the term “mesothermal” for mostly goldonly deposits in metamorphic terranes and greenstone belts<ref>citation</ref> The term mesothermal refers to temperatures between 175 and 300&nbsp;°C and a formation depth of 12–36&nbsp;km In 1993 the term orogenic gold deposits was introduced as gold deposits of this type have a similar origin and gold mineralization is structurally controlled

 Temporal pattern 
File:Orogenic Gold AgespngAmalgamation of disrupted continental masses to form new supercontinents known as Wilson Cycle</ref> Orogenic gold deposits were only formed in certain time slices of the History of Earth</ref><ref name"C Meyer1988">citation</ref> Orogenic gold deposits are mainly concentrated in three epochs of Earth history: (1) Neoarchean 28–25 Ga (2) Paleoproterozoic 21–18 Ga and (3) Phanerozoic 0500–005 Ga With an absence in the period 180–08 Ga The timebound nature of many mineral deposits reflects the breakup or formation of supercontinents which most likely also applies for orogenic gold deposits

 Fluid source 
In magmatic systems ores and host rocks are derived from the same fluid In the case of hydrothermal fluids host rocks are older than the predominantly aqueous fluids that carry and deposit metals and thus complicate defining a host rock associated with gold fluid formation A number of rock types have been suggested as the source of orogenic gold but due to the variability of host rocks in Earth’s history and depositscale their relation to Earthscale gold formation processes is unclear<ref>citation</ref> Furthermore age dating of the deposits and their host rocks shows that there are large time gaps in their formation Age dating indicates that mineralization took place 10 to 100 Ma after the formation of the host rocks<ref>citation</ref> These temporal gaps suggest an overall genetic independence of the fluid formation and that of local Lithology
 Mineralogy and geochemistry 
File:Goldquartz hydrothermal vein (Brazil) (17036750925)jpgGeochemical studies on gold bearing quartzcarbonate veins are important to determine temperature pressure at which the veins were generated and the chemical signature of fluids Quartz is generally the dominant mineral in the veins but there are also gold bearing carbonate dominant veins in orogenic deposits Ore bodies of orogenic gold deposits are generally defined by ≤ 3–5% sulfide minerals most commonly arsenopyrite in Metasedimentary rock
In general hydrothermal fluids are characterized by low salinities (up to 12 wt% Sodium chloride
 Genetic models 
Orogenic gold deposits formed in metamorphosed terranes of all ages that have little in common except for being sites of complexity and low mean stress For this reason a discussion of the gold deposit formation in a universal genetic model is most difficult and several models have been considered The fundamental control of the chemical signature of orogenic gold fluids can most likely be found in the processes that take place in the source region Therefore the discussion about genetic models of orogenic gold deposits concentrates on the possible source of goldbearing fluids

 Midcrustal fluid source 
A model that fits most of the gold provinces and provides some of the major gold resources entails a metamorphic fluid source In this style of gold deposit gold and other elements have been released into metamorphic fluids from material accreted to a craton during subductionrelated scenarios Composition of produced fluids vary depending on the P–T conditions and rock chemistry and may be influenced by fluid rockrock interactions along the pathway Created and reactivated faults serve as pathways for hydrothermal solutions

 Subcrustal fluid source 
The model of a subcrustal source is similar to the middlecrustal model In both cases fluids and metals formed from volcanic and sedimentary products in tectonic processes but also show differences in the origin of the source and the processes involved This model is associated with fluid ascent from devolatilization of a Subduction

 Tectonics and gold formation 
Although efforts have been made to define a specific deformation structure associated with the formation of orogenic gold deposits

 Geodynamic setting and architecture 
Largescale lithospheric deformation structures correlate with gold endowment and active structural permeability in the crust is controlled by the prevailing tectonic stress field<ref>citation</ref> There is an increasing body of evidence that the formation of orogenic gold deposits is tied to specific GeodynamicsFile:Crosssection of a subduction zone and backarc basinjpgA variety of gold deposits are formed in accretionary orogens including orogenic gold deposits<ref>citation</ref> Orogenic gold deposits are typically located in metamorphosed forearc and backarc regions as well as in the arc and show a close spatial relationship to lamprophyres and associated felsic porphyry dikes and sills<ref>citation</ref> Lamprophyre dykes are not the source of the ore fluid itself but indicate a deep lithospheric connection for fluid conduits<ref>citation</ref>

Orogenic gold deposits show a spatial relationship to structural discontinuities including faults fractures dilatation zones and shear zones The ore hosting structures are subsidiary faults or shear zones (mostly D3–D4 in a D1 to D4 structural sequence) which are always related to a major regionalscale deformation structures such as lithospheric boundaries and suture zones The deformation structures hosting the gold deposits are typically discordant with respect to the stratigraphic layering of the host rocks The mineralised structures indicate syn to postmineralisation displacements such as slickensides formed under hydrothermal conditions The geometry of vein systems is primarily influenced by a combination of dynamic stress changes and fluid pressure variations<ref>citation</ref>

 Timeline of global mineralization 
Improved Geochronology
Proceeding the Archean the next episode of orogenic gold deposit formation was from 21 to 18 Ga following the breakup of an Archean supercontinent and subsequent orogenic processes which ensued or due to erosion of narrow continental margins in which the orogenic gold was mineralized

The formation of Gondwana
The breakup of Pangea in the mesozoic is the event which marks the final major global distribution of orogenic gold deposits This event created an immense range of subduction zones surrounding the Pacific ocean To the east of the Pacific the Cordilleran Region
 Economics 
File:Sunrise Dam Gold Mine open pit 11jpgOrogenic gold deposits are responsible for approximately 75% of the worlds gold production at over 1 billion ounces when accounting that the origin of many gold placer deposits were orogenic in nature The price of gold at a given time will have an impact on whether a deposit will be economically feasible The economic viability of a deposit will also depend on the grade and tonnage of the Mineral reserve
The typical grade of unmineralized Igneous rock
 Environmental effects
