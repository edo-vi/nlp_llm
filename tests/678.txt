An Cholera outbreaks and pandemics
Vulnerable to waterborne diseases before the conflict 16 months went by before a program of oral vaccines was started The government of Yemen stopped funding public health in 2016; and healthcare workers either fled the country or were not paid

The UNICEF and World Health Organization (WHO) executive directors stated: "This deadly cholera outbreak is the direct consequence of two years of heavy conflict Collapsing health water and sanitation systems have cut off 145 million people from regular access to clean water and sanitation increasing the ability of the disease to spread Rising rates of malnutrition have weakened childrens health and made them more vulnerable to disease An estimated 30000 dedicated local health workers who play the largest role in ending this outbreak have not been paid their salaries for nearly ten months"

Background
File:Cholera bacteria SEMjpgAs of 2017 Yemen had a population of 25 million and was geographically divided into 22 Governorates of Yemen
The Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)
Cholera is an infection of the small intestine by strain (biology)
Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to drinking water
Outbreak
File:Yemen  Cumulative Cholera Casesgif
Following "on the heels of civil conflict between Houthi rebels and the internationally recognized Yemeni regime" the Yemen cholera outbreak began in early October 2016 and by January 2017 the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (WHO EMRO) considered the outbreak to be unusual in its rapid and wide geographical spread  The serotype of vibrio cholerae O1 involved is Ougawa

The earliest cases were predominantly in the capital Sanaa By the end of October cases had been reported in the governorates of Al Bayda Governorate
Using genomic sequencing researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Institut Pasteur concluded the strain of cholera originated in eastern Africa and was carried to Yemen by migrants

Morbidity and mortality
Yemen authorities announced the cholera outbreak on October 7 2016  By the end of that year there were 96 deaths

Following the October 2016 outbreak the rate of spread in most areas declined by the end of February 2017 and by midMarch 2017 the outbreak was in decline after a wave of cold weather

The number of cholera cases resurged in a second wave that began on 27 April 2017 According to Qadri Islam and Clemens writing in The New England Journal of Medicine the dramatic April 2017 resurgence was "coincident with heavy rains that may have contaminated drinking water sources and was amplified by warrelated destruction of municipal water and sewage systems"

During May 2017 74311 suspected cases including 605 deaths were reported The two agencies stated that it was then "the worst cholera outbreak in the world"

By 4 July 2017 there were 269608 cases and the death toll was at 1614 with a case fatality rate of 06% On 14 August 2017 the WHO updated the number of suspected cholera cases to 500000 Oxfam said in 2017 the outbreak would become the largest epidemic since recordkeeping began overtaking the 754373 cases of cholera recorded after the 2010 Haiti earthquake In six months more people were ill with cholera in Yemen than in seven years after the earthquake in Haiti and the situation in Yemen was made worse by hunger and malnutrition

On 22 December 2017 WHO reported the number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen had surpassed one million

By October 2018 there were more than 12&nbsp;million cases reported and more than 2500 people—58% children—have died in the Yemen cholera outbreak which is the worst epidemic in recorded history and was according to the United Nations (UN) the worst humanitarian crisis in the world  Between 1 January 2018 to 31 May 2020 the cumulative total number of suspected cases was 1371819 with 1566 associated deaths The case fatality rate for the outbreak was 011% as of 2020 having declined from a high of 1% when the outbreak first began

Causes and challenges
UNICEF and the WHO attributed the outbreak to malnutrition collapsing sanitation and clean water systems due to the countrys ongoing conflict and the approximately 30000 local health care workers who had not been paid for almost a year These factors resulted in a delayed vaccination program which was not started until more than one million people were already ill

Precivil war conditions
Even before civil war affected Yemen it was "beset by circumstances that made it ripe for cholera" A country with high poverty rates Yemen also suffered frequent droughts and severe water access problems with only about half of the population having had access to good WASH
Children under five showed a high prevalence of malnutrition making them further susceptible to disease;

Ongoing conflict
Because of the ongoing conflict in Yemen and resulting displacement of people who do not have adequate food waster housing or sanitation preexisting conditions were exacerbated Shortages have been made worse by naval and air blockades Bombing has damaged water and sanitation infrastructure Airstrikes have destroyed facilities in the country for health care; "half of the nations hospitals have been either destroyed by Saudi airstrikes occupied by rebel forces or shut down because there are no medical personnel to staff them"

Doctors Without Borders reported that a Saudi Arabian Saudi Arabianled intervention in Yemen
Grant Pritchard Save the Childrens interim country director for Yemen stated in April 2017 "With the right medicines these diseases are all completely treatable – but the Saudi Arabialed coalition is stopping them from getting in"

 Wastewater and solid waste management systems 
File:Wastewater stabilization pond (2963784219)jpgYemens wastewater and solid waste management systems are the least developed among Middle Eastern countries which has been a major contributor to the cholera outbreak With 16 functional sewage treatment plants (STPs) and a growing population the countrys sewage systems are illequipped to meet the needs of citizens and serve just 7% of the population Actual flow rates through the STPs in Yemen exceed the flow rates they were designed to accommodate which reduces their efficiency

The treatment processes used are also suboptimal with 68% of STPs using only Waste stabilization pond
Moreover wastewater in Yemen is frequently reused for irrigation purposes by farmers due to a lack of awareness about safety risks High concentrations of Escherichia coli Streptococcus faecalis Klebsiella pneumoniae Enterobacter aerogenes Salmonella&nbsp; typhi S typhimurium and Shigella sonnei  among other harmful fecal coliforms  are present in this wastewater and transmit to humans when they consume foods irrigated by it

Official dumping sites for solid waste are being created increasingly close to communities which has increased the risk of infection and general health issues among citizens This is especially true for the roughly 70% of citizens without access to potable water who consume water from wells near dumping sites

 El Niño 
File:Chironomid (7174749925)jpgThe El Niño–Southern Oscillation phenomenon is a major driver of climate variability associated with health outcomes including influencing cholera dynamics due to changes in rainfall For example in East Africa there was an upsurge in cholera cases in areas with increased rainfall along with an increase in cases in areas with decreased rainfall  This alludes to a possible connection between cholera in East Africa and Yemen Chironomidae are natural reservoirs and carriers of the Vibrio cholerae bacterium It has been suggested that adult chironomidae may aerially carry the bacterium between bodies of water assisting in the transmission of cholera Based on this evidence it is hypothesized that the El Nino conditions over the Gulf of Aden may have contributed to the transmission of cholera from the Horn of Africa to Yemen through wind effects on choleracontaminated flying insects

Health services and infrastructure collapse
As of 2016 the government ended funding for public health leaving many employees without salary A monthslong strike of sanitation workers over unpaid wages contributed to the accumulation of garbage that entered the water supply

Qadri Islam and Clemens write that the dramatic April 2017 resurgence coincided with heavy rains and "was amplified by warrelated destruction of municipal water and sewage systems" An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) worker in Yemen noted that Aprils cholera resurgence began ten days after Sanaas sewer system stopped working

Raslan et al write in Frontiers in Public Health:

 Rainy season 
Epidemiological modelling of the outbreak from October 2016 to January 2016 together with satellite imagederived meteorological data showed that the rainfall had a strong impact in increasing the chances of transmission with the rainy season of April 2017 having coincided with the onset of the second wave of the outbreak topping at more than 50000 cases per week The geography of Yemen means that the Western mountainous plateau sees more rainfall and has therefore an increased risk of high cholera incidence due to water precipitations

Lack of vaccination

The International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision which maintains vaccine stockpiles for cholera announced a plan in June 2017 to send one million doses of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) to Yemen but this plan stalled  The request for vaccine was retracted

In May 2018 the first OCV campaign in Yemen was launched The WHO and UNICEF delivered oral vaccines to 540000 individuals in August 2018

Federspiel and Ali write in BioMed Central
 COVID19 pandemic 
The COVID19 pandemic in Yemen is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 As of 12 November 2020 there were 2070 confirmed cases and 602 deaths The COVID19 pandemic has further burdened the already overwhelmed healthcare system in Yemen fighting a number of diseases including cholera dengue fever and malaria Only half of existing health facilities are fully functioning while more than 179 million people of a total population of 30 million need health care services in 2020

 Humanitarian activity 
Through 2018 several humanitarian healthcare organizations had reported activity to contain the cholera outbreak The International Committee of the Red Cross have supported 17 treatment centers with supplies including IV fluids oral rehydration therapy supplies antibiotics chlorine tablets in addition to sending engineers to help restore water distribution in Yemen The International Rescue Committee (IRC) supplied seven hospitals with medicine and supplies deployed health teams and trained volunteers delivered health and nutrition services and facilitated referrals of malnourished children

The World Health Organization coordinated the Yemen Health Cluster with 40 member organizations and together with Health and Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH
Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) said it treated at least 103000 individuals in 37 locations

 Global responses 

 Canada 
As of June 2 2020 Canada has pledged $40 million in humanitarian aid for Yemen to help the politically unstable country cope with cholera malaria dengue fever and diphtheria along with COVID19 This brings Canadas total contributions to Yemen since 2015 to $220 million which contributes towards the goal of US$24 billion for underfunded humanitarian programs run by UN agencies and humanitarian organizations in Yemen

 Saudi Arabia 
Saudi Arabia has been backing the Yemen government in the fight against the Houthi rebels and they are also one of the top donors for UN humanitarian aid operations in Yemen On 23 June 2017 Saudi Arabias crown prince Mohammed bin Salman authorized a donation in excess of $66 million for cholera relief in Yemen

Mohammed alJaber the Saudi ambassador to Yemen has announced half a billion dollars from Saudi Arabia to support UN programs in 2020

 United Nations 
An aid conference was held in Geneva in April 2017 that raised half of the US$21&nbsp;billion that the United Nations (UN) estimated was needed

As of July 8 2019 the UN and partners are running 1200 cholera treatment facilities around the country however funding is an issue The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan required $42 billion to deliver assistance but they ended up receiving $36 billion For the 2020 plan the UN has so far received 15% of the necessary $35 billion needed

 United States 
On April 3 2018 the United States (US) announced $87 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help the people of Yemen bringing the US total assistance since 2017 to more than $854 million This money will be used for food assistance safe drinking water emergency shelter and medical supplies The US is also planning to provide $55 million in economic and development assistance including programs to support livelihoods rebuild infrastructure and restore access to education

On March 27 2020 the Trump administration cut $70 million in assistance destined for northern Yemen framing the decreased funding as a response to the interference of Houthi rebels The US officials were concerned that the assistance was directed to fighters instead of civilians South Yemen which is less populous still received aid dollars

 United Kingdom 
The United Kingdom (UK) government has been one of the largest humanitarian donors to Yemen budgeting £139 million in 2017/2018 and earmarking £8m from the Yemen budget specifically to respond to cholera The UK has partnered with organizations including UNICEF and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Ukraine
 World Bank 
On August 25 2017 the World Bank announced $200 million US to support Yemen as it struggles to contain the cholera outbreak This money is being used to strengthen the countrys health water and sanitation systems

 Statistics 

The WHO provided regular outbreak updates for the epidemic in Yemen up until August 2020 Since then the epidemic has declined in numbers of cases and deaths with 2020 seeing a total of 230540 suspected cases and 84 deaths and 5676 suspected cases with two deaths between January 1 and March 6 of 2021 Furthermore UNICEF reports that in 2021 over 190000 children received a cholera vaccine achieving 94% coverage
