 Characteristics 
Whiting event clouds consist of calcium carbonate Polymorphism (materials science)
 Potential causes 
Some debate exists surrounding the exact cause of whiting events And although much research exists on the subject there is still no definitive consensus on the chemical mechanisms behind it The three most common suggested causes for the phenomenon are: microbiological processes resuspension of marine or bottom sediments and spontaneous direct precipitation from water Of these three the last has been ruled unlikely due to the unfavorable reaction kinetics of spontaneous calcium carbonate precipitation It is also worth noting that it may be possible for more than one of the aforementioned factors to contribute to whiting events in the same region

 Microbiological activity 
Substantial findings indicate Photosynthesis

 Sediment resuspension 
In shallower waters evidence supports that activity of local fisherman and marine life such as fish and certain shark species can disturb bottom sediments containing calcium carbonate particles and lead to their suspension   

 Relevance 
Whiting events have a unique effect on the waters around them The fact that calcium carbonate clouds increase turbidity and light reflectance holds implications for organisms and processes that depend on light The cyanobacteria abundant clouds also hold the potential to act as a means to study the microorganisms role in carbon cycling (especially in relation to climate change) and their possible role in finding petroleum source rocks
