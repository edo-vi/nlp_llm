Dislocation of hip (coxofemoral luxation) may occur in domestic animals

It is a not rare condition usually unilateral in:
 cattle among others after calving
 Hip dysplasia (canine)
The same illness also exists in dislocation of hip
The condition can be observed after the forced traction of fetus while delivery slip of animal on a floor 
More commonly seen in animals with poor nutrient ration at end stage of gestation which results in osteoporosis of bones & joints due go which acetabulum notch become shallow and femur comes out if it while delivery ketonemia also has adverse effect on coxofemoral luxation

Symptoms
In dogs it occurs mainly in an upwards and forwards direction Hence the affected leg is shortened and the greater trochanter prominent

In cattle it occurs mainly craniodorsally or caudoventrally but other directions are possible A typical stance is seen in craniodorsal luxations with a shortened limb and a protrusion of greater trochanter

Treatment
Attempts in reduction in cattle are generally not successful Affected animals at least not too heavy ones can live with the disease for a long time because of the formation of a sort of pseudojoint in the hip

Dogs with hip dysplasia and unilateral dislocation can live if the other leg is not too severely hit Then there is a severe muscular atrophy of the  thigh Compensation occurs with musculation of the shoulders
