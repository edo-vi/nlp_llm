The New Qing History () is a historiographical School of thought
According to some scholars at the height of their power the Qing regarded China (proper) as only a part although a very important part of Qing dynasty in Inner Asia
Some scholars like Pingti Ho have criticized the approach for exaggerating the Manchu character of the dynasty while scholars like Zhao Gang have argued from the evidence that the Qing dynasty selfidentified as China Some Chinese scholars accuse the American historians in the group of imposing American concerns with race and identity or even of imperialist misunderstanding to weaken China Still others in China agree that this scholarship has opened new vistas for the study of Qing history Inspired by New Qing History studies the name "New Ming History" has also appeared which refers to the emerging Mingcentred studies that give emphasis on the Ming dynasty in Inner Asia
The use of "New Qing History" as an approach is to be distinguished from the multivolume history of the Qing dynasty that the State Council of the Peoples Republic of China has been writing since 2003 which is also occasionally called "New Qing History" in English Nevertheless this state project a revision of the 1928 Draft History of Qing was said to be written pretty much to refute the New Qing History

Views
Prominent scholars who have been associated with the New Qing History including Evelyn Rawski Mark Elliott (historian)
The military expansion of frontiers were sometimes expensive and drained resources from the rest of China Some seemed to have argued that the Manchuruled Qing was more comparable to the Ottoman Empire
Mark Elliot points out that the most critical academic propositions of the New Qing History are the following:

 Discovers the Inner Asian dimension under Manchu rule
 Advocates the use of nonChinese historical materials (especially Manchu language Pays attention to the context of global history

Origins

The origins of the New Qing History lie in Inner Asia
The Grand Council (Qing dynasty)
The New Qing History took on distinct form in the mid1990s In 1993 Crossley and Rawski summarized the arguments for using Manchu language
In response Pingti Ho published "In Defense of Sinicization: A Rebuttal of Evelyn Rawskis Reenvisioning the Qing" He argued that the pattern of Chinese history was for a conquest dynasty to adopt Chinese ways of rule and culture and attacked Rawski for Manchucentrism

The school that is now known as the "New Qing History" developed after the debate In 2011 historian Huang Pei published a monograph that developed the objections stated by Ho Pingti 

There are differences among the scholars in the loose group For example Evelyn Rawskis Reenvisioning the Qing: The Significance of the Qing Period in Chinese History in 1996 regarded the Qing as a Manchu empire with China being only one part Nevertheless Pamela Kyle Crossley sees the empire not as a Manchu empire but as a "simultaneous" system in which the rulership is not subordinate to the Chinese or any other single culture She criticized the new "Manchucentered" school for romanticism and a reliance upon disproved theories about "Altaic languages
American historian Richard J Smith reported that an interpretive "middle ground" had emerged between the views of Rawski and Crossley on one hand and Ho and Huang on the other Smith indicated that based on the idea that "Qing empire" and "China" might not be the same thing the Qing had to be placed in a context that included Inner Asia in general and that saw China in a global field The less "sinocentric" view Smith continued which placed less emphasis on "sinicization" had won over most China scholars in the West (and increasingly also in China) in spite of debates over "matters of degree" Nevertheless he pointed out "China proper” (often designated 内地 meaning "inner territory" in Chinese) refers to the core eighteenth provinces of the Qing dynasty but from a Manchu perspective however the concept of “China” (Chinese: Zhongguo; Manchu: Dulimbai Gurun) embraced the entire empire including Manchuria Mongolia Xinjiang and Tibet

Responses
The arguments put forward in the New Qing History inspired debate on a number of specific points including the concept of "China" during the Qing dynasty

Regarding the concept "China"
The scholar Zhao Gang responded against the revisionist historians by noting that some claimed that the Qing used only "China" (中國) to encompass only Han people (漢人) and "China proper" and pointed out that in fact that China proper and Han people were not synonymous with "China" in the Qing view according to Mark Elliotts own work The Han dynasty used Zhongguo (中國) to refer only to Han areas but the Qing dynasty reinvented the definition of Zhongguo (中國) to refer to nonHan areas as well Zhao Gang cited Qing documents with Qing being used for the Manchu term Dulimbai Gurun (a direct translation of "中國" Zhongguo; "Middle Kingdom") in Manchu texts and Zhongguo in Chinese texts to refer to the entire Qing including Manchuria Xinjiang Mongolia and Tibet as "China" Names of the Qing dynasty
Elena Barabantseva has also noted that the Manchu referred to all subjects of the Qing empire regardless of ethnicity as "Chinese" (中國之人) and they used the term Zhongguo (中國) as a synonym for the entire Qing empire but used "Hanren" (漢人) to refer only to the core area of the empire with the entire empire viewed as multiethnic

William T Rowe wrote that the name "China" (Chinese: 中國 or 中華) was apparently understood to refer to the political realm of the Han Chinese during the Ming dynasty and this understanding persisted among the Han Chinese into the early Qing dynasty and the understanding was also shared by Aisin Gioro rulers before the MingQing transition The Qing however "came to refer to their more expansive empire not only as the Great Qing but also nearly interchangeably as China" within a few decades of this development Instead of the earlier (Ming) idea of an ethnic Han Chinese state this new Qing China was a "selfconsciously multiethnic state" Han Chinese scholars had some time to adapt this but by the early 19th century the notion of China as a multinational state with new significantly extended borders had become the standard terminology for Han Chinese writers (such as Wei Yuan) Rowe noted that "these were the origins of the China we know today" He added that while the early Qing rulers viewed themselves as multihatted emperors who ruled several nationalities "separately but simultaneously" by the mid19th century the Qing Empire had become part of a Europeanstyle community of sovereign states and entered into a series of treaties with the West and such treaties and documents consistently referred to Qing rulers as the "Emperor of China" and his administration as the "Government of China"

Joseph W Esherick observes that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier nonHan areas in a different separate system under the Lifan Yuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (中國) and made it "flexible" by using that term to refer to the entire empire

Other points
Scholars have disagreed on whether or how much the Manchu rulers used new forms of imperial ritual to display new forms of empire or continued rituals from the Ming to show that they saw themselves as heirs of a Han Chinese empire Roger Des Forges review of David M Robinsons Martial Spectacles of the Ming Court criticized scholars of conquest dynasties and New Qing History and disagreed with the idea that  the "Royal hunt" was a differing factor between Han Chinese and conquest dynasties He noted that the martial themed Ming dynasty Grand Review (China)
The New Qing History according to Tristan G Brown writing in 2011 did not explore the example of Islam and Muslims to test their argument that the early Qing emperors aspired to be universal monarchs Brown finds that an inscription by the Qianlong emperor showed that he wanted to incorporate both Xinjiang and Islam into his empire and that this inscription along with the "inventive structural duality of ChineseIslamic architecture with Central Asian TurkishIslamic architectural forms" makes the "most compelling case" that New Qing History is also applicable to Chinese Islam

Criticisms by Chinese scholars
In the journal Chinese Social Sciences Today an official publication of the stateaffiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Li Zhiting a scholar working on the National Qing Dynasty Compilation Committee charged that "New Qing History is academically absurd and politically does damage to the unity of China" He sought to "expose its mask of pseudoacademic scholarship eliminating the deleterious effect it has had on scholarship in China" Li went on to charge that the "whole range of views New Qing History scholars express are cliches and stereotypes little more than dusted off versions in a scholarly tone of the Western imperialism and Japanese imperialism of the 19th century" American scholars such as Evelyn Rawski Mark Elliott Pamela Kyle Crossley and James Millward Li continued "view the history of China from an imperialist standpoint with imperialist points of view and imperialist eyes regarding traditional China as an empire regarding the Qing dynasty as Qing dynasty imperialism"

Zhong Han a Chinese scholar and researcher of Manchu and early Qing history argued that the socalled “simultaneous emperorship” makes no sense and about New Qing Historys "apparent intermixture of scholarship and politics" The school as Zhong put it looks at the Qing dynasty "as if it were the owner of an apartment building in which each unit is occupied by an individual ethnic group The Han Chinese but an occupant of one unit is no more entitled than others" For Zhong it is totally groundless to view the Qing as a Westernstyle colonial empire let alone separating Qing and China Distasted of accusations such as Qing dynasty was not analogous to China Zhong employed much evidence to make his points using not the Han language literature but also Manchu language
