Environmental and wildlife protection
 The United States Endangered Species Act of 1973 imposes development restrictions on landowners who find endangered species on their property While this policy has some positive effects for wildlife it also encourages preemptive habitat destruction (Swamp draining In 2005 the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change began an incentive scheme to cut down on greenhouse gases Companies disposing of polluting gases were rewarded with carbon credits which could eventually get converted into cash The program set prices according to how serious the damage the pollutant could do to the environment was and attributed one of the highest bounties for destroying HFC23 a byproduct of a common coolant HCFC22 As a result companies began to produce more of this coolant in order to destroy more of the byproduct waste gas and collect millions of dollars in credits This increased production also caused the price of the refrigerant to decrease significantly motivating refrigeration companies to continue using it despite the adverse environmental effects In 2013 credits for the destruction of HFC23 were suspended in the European Union

 Historic preservation schemes 
As an incentive to preserve historical buildings governments may designate older structures as historical properties; such classification may prevent or impede further sale or alteration of the property Any compensation offered may be significantly less than normal commercial returns on properties or land 
Examples related to this type of perverse incentive include:
 The United Kingdoms listed building regulations are intended to protect historically important buildings by requiring owners to seek permission before making changes to buildings that have been listed In 2017 the owners of an unlisted historic building in Bristol destroyed a 400yearold ceiling the day before a scheduled visit by listings officers allegedly to prevent the building from being listed which could have limited future development
 According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation an increase in arson in the United States in the 1970s may have been the result of perverse incentives arising from government regulation: In particular the Tax Reform Act of 1976 provided for loss of tax benefits if owners demolished buildings possibly promoting arson as a way of clearing land without financial penalty The law was later altered to remove this aspect
