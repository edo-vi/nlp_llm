In mineralogy a relict mineral is a surviving mineral from a parent rock that underwent a  destructive or transformative process  For example serpentinite is a kind of rock formed in a process called serpentinization in which a host mineral produces a pseudomorph and the original mineral is eventually replaced and/or destroyed but is still present until the process is complete<ref>Cite encyclopedia

Within geomorphology a relict landform is a landform that took form from geomorphic processes that are not active at present In a Scandinavian context this is often meant to imply that relict landforms were formed before the Weichselian glaciation
