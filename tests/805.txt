 Intelligent systems 
Intelligence is conventionally defined in terms of goalachieving problemsolving or patternrecognizing capability Recent development in machine learning gives rise to systems that can attempt to emulate those intelligent behaviours AlphaGo a machine learning system developed by DeepMind became the first computer program to AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol
 Sentient beings 

One major Buddhist goal is to remove suffering for all Sentient beings (Buddhism) Buddhist principles in AI system design 

 Somparn Promta and Kenneth Einar Himma 
Scholars Somparn Promta and Kenneth Einar Himma have said that for Buddhists the advancement of artificial intelligence can only be instrumentally good not good a priori Perhaps then the main tasks of AI designers and developers may be twofold: to set ethical and pragmatic goals for AI systems and to fulfil the goals with AI in morally permissible manners Promta and Himma say that applying Buddhist principles to accomplish these tasks may be possible and practical

Prompta and Himmar say there are two primafacie goals for creating artificially intelligent systems The first goal is to create these systems in such a way that maximally fulfils our crude sensory desires and worldly instincts of survival just as we did for designing other tools in general S Promta et al maintains that it is possible that the majority of AI developers implicitly pursue this goal when they design AI machines as can be observed by their overscrutiny of superficial technicalities of these machines instead of their wider functionalities  The second goal on the other hand is to transcend these desires and  instincts According to Buddhism this goal is more worth pursuing than the former one In Brahmajāla Sutta the Buddha holds that sensuality as well as the beliefs and instincts they induce are what confines beings to suffering  Expounding his Four Noble Truths
 Thomas Doctor Olaf Witkowski Elizaveta Solomonova Bill Duane Michael Levin 
Inspired by the Bodhisattva vow Thomas Doctor Olaf Witkowski Elizaveta Solomonova Bill Duane and Michael Levin proposed the slogan <nowiki>intelligence as care</nowiki> to try revising the current convention of defining intelligence  It then follows that one proposal for improving the current AI system design is to use Bodhisattva vow as a guiding principle for setting AI design goals Generally Bodhisattva vow has four components; upon taking the vow one makes a strong commitment (Pali: Adhiṭṭhāna) to achieve the following: 

 to liberate all beings (from suffering) which are boundless; 
 to extirpate all suffering which are countless; 
 to be established in all techniques of practicing Dharma (Pali: dhammakkhandha  Sanskrit: dharmaskandha) which are endless; 
 to experience the ultimate and highest Enlightenment in Buddhism
In essence T Doctor et al defined the Bodhisattva vow as a formal commitment to exercise infinite Care to alleviate all stress suffering or Duḥkha for all sentient beings: "for the sake of all sentient life I shall achieve awakening"

 Generally 
Generally some believe that from the nonviolence principle of Buddhism artificial intelligence should not be used to cause harm

 Notable Buddhisminspired AI instantiations 
While exploring the possibilities of realizing spiritual figures digitally P Pataranutaporn et al implemented a chatbot named <nowiki>Buddha bot</nowiki> as an AI embodiment of the Buddha It allows users to ask it questions and have conversations with it It uses machine learning concepts to process languages and give responses

In 2017 a funeral service began using <nowiki></nowiki>Pepper (robot)
