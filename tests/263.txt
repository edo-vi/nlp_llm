In biblical studies inclusio is a literary device based on a concentric principle also known as bracketing or an envelope structure which consists of creating a frame by placing similar material at the beginning and end of a section although whether this material should consist of a word or a phrase or whether greater amounts of text also qualify and of what length the frames section should be are matters of some debate Inclusio is found in various sources both antique and new The purpose of an inclusio may be structural  to alert the reader to a particularly important theme  or it may serve to show how the material within the inclusio relates to the inclusio itself An important case of this occurs in the Gospel of Marks treatment of the "Cursing of the Fig Tree" and the "Cleansing of the Temple" (Chapter 11) By giving the first half of the story before the Cleansing of the Temple and the conclusion after Mark creates a "frame" that effectively highlights that he wants the Cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the Cursing of the Fig Tree  ie Jesus actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure but a judgment against it

In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament)

While this may not be evident to many of the Bibles modern day readers the Hebrew Bible is full of literary devices some of which having fallen out of favor over the years are lost on most modern readers Inclusio of which many instances can be found in the Bible is one of these although many instances of its usage are not apparent to those reading translations of the Bible rather than the Hebrew language
Particularly noteworthy are the many instances of inclusio in the Book of Jeremiah A rather farflung example of inclusio in the Book of Jeremiah can be found in its first section chapters 1–24 which are enveloped both by a similar question in the first and last episode (1:11 24:3) and by similar imagery—that of almond rods and baskets of figs Inclusio may also be found between chapters 36 and 45 both of which mention Baruch ben Nerya to whom Jeremiahs prophecies were entrusted Bracketing can also be seen in The Lords sayings in 1:10 and 24:6 Indeed the whole book save for its last (52nd) chapter—which some claim was appended to it—can be thought of as inside the inclusio formed by 1:1 and 51:64 both of which mention the preaching of Jeremiah (דברי ירמיה) thus implying the lateness of chapter 52; although analyzing whether so trivial a measure has any meaning but that which appeases the eye is best left to the astute reader None of this is to say that the shorter forms of inclusio—those in which the section enframed is quite shorter—are not found in the Book of Jeremiah An example is found in Jeremiah 4:22 which reads:

verse translation

The phrase "לא ידעו" (did not know) is found at the beginning and the end of The Lords analysis of his people English translations do not preserve this structure

Inclusio also abounds in other books of the Bible An obvious example of inclusio is found in the first and last (29th) verses of Psalm 118 "הודו לה כיטוב כי לעולם חסדו" Another more disputed example may be found in the Book of Ruth where one finds a certain resemblance if somewhat chiastic between 1:1 and 1:22—in the former Elimelekh leaves Bethlehem in favor of Moab and in the latter Ruth and Naomi (Bible)
In Rabbinic Literature

The rabbis of the Talmud were aware of occurrences of inclusio in the Bible as shown by Rabbi Yohanan
Many chapters of Mishnah are also framed by inclusio In the opening mishnah of Taanit (Talmud)
Examples of inclusio may be found in later rabbinic literature as well Tosefta Makkot Chapter 3 opens and closes with statements regarding the designation of three cities of refuge Homilies regarding Isaiah 32:20 appear at the beginning and end of tracate Bava Kamma Chapter 1 The opening homily of Leviticus Rabba 29 asserts that the fate of Adam on the day of his creation is a sign for his children annually on the same date and the closing homily of this section asserts that when Israel observes the commandments of this day God will regard them as having been created anew Rabbinic redactors following in the footsteps of their biblical predecessors continued to employ inclusio as a literary marker and tool

In the New Testament

The New Testament also uses inclusio The main teaching part in the Sermon on the Mount starts and ends with the expression "the Law and the Prophets" (Matthew 5:17 + 7:12) Gospel of Matthew
