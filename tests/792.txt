Hypothesis
File:Repliee Q2jpg
Moris original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human some observers emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathycite journal 

</ref> When plotted on a graph the reactions are indicated by a deep trough (hence the "valley" part of the name) in the areas where anthropomorphism is closest to reality

This area of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a "somewhat human" and "fully human" entity is the uncanny valley The name captures the idea that an almost humanlooking robot seems overly "strange" to some human beings produces a feeling of uncanniness and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive human–robot interaction

Theoretical basis

A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanism underlying the phenomenon:
 Mate selection: Automatic stimulusdriven appraisals of uncanny stimuli elicit aversion by activating an evolved cognitive mechanism for the avoidance of Mate choice Mortality salience:  disassembled androidsplay on subconscious fears of reduction replacement and annihilation: (1) A mechanism with a human façade and a mechanical interior plays on our subconscious fear that we are all just soulless machines (2) Androids in various states of mutilation decapitation or disassembly are reminiscent of a battlefield after a conflict and as such serve as a reminder of our mortality (3) Since most androids are copies of actual people they are doppelgängers and may elicit a fear of being replaced on the job in a relationship and so on (4) The jerkiness of an androids movements could be unsettling because it elicits a fear of losing bodily control
 Pathogen avoidance: Uncanny stimuli may activate a cognitive mechanism that originally evolved to motivate the avoidance of potential sources of pathogens by eliciting a disgust response "The more human an organism looks the stronger the aversion to its defects because (1) defects indicate disease (2) more humanlooking organisms are more closely related to human beings genetically and (3) the probability of contracting diseasecausing bacteria viruses and other parasites increases with genetic similarity"
 Sorites paradoxes: Stimuli with human and nonhuman traits undermine our sense of human identity by linking qualitatively different categories human and nonhuman by a quantitative metric: degree of human likeness
 Violation of human norms: If an entity looks sufficiently nonhuman its human characteristics are noticeable generating empathy However if the entity looks almost human it elicits our model of a human other and its detailed normative expectations The nonhuman characteristics are noticeable giving the human viewer a sense of strangeness In other words a robot stuck inside the uncanny valley is no longer judged by the standards of a robot doing a passable job at pretending to be human but is instead judged by the standards of a human doing a terrible job at acting like a normal person This has been linked to perceptual uncertainty and the theory of predictive coding
 Conflicting perceptual cues: The negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations Perceptual tension occurs when an individual perceives conflicting cues to Categorization Threat to humans distinctiveness and identity: Negative reactions toward very humanlike robots can be related to the challenge that this kind of robot leads to the categorical human – nonhuman distinction Kaplan stated that these new machines challenge human uniqueness pushing for a redefinition of humanness Ferrari Paladino and Jetten found that the increase of anthropomorphic appearance of a robot leads to an enhancement of threat to the human distinctiveness and identity The more a robot resembles a real person the more it represents a challenge to our social identity as human beings
 Religious definition of human identity: The existence of artificial but humanlike entities is viewed by some as a threat to the concept of human identity An example can be found in the theoretical framework of psychiatrist Irvin Yalom Yalom explains that humans construct psychological defenses to avoid existential anxiety stemming from death One of these defenses is specialness the irrational belief that aging and death as central premises of life apply to all others but oneself The experience of the very humanlike "living" robot can be so rich and compelling that it challenges humans notions of "specialness" and existential defenses eliciting existential anxiety In folklore the creation of humanlike but soulless beings is often shown to be unwise as with the golem in Judaism whose absence of human empathy and spirit can lead to disaster however good the intentions of its creator
 Uncanny valley of the mind or AI: Due to rapid advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence and affective computing cognitive scientists have also suggested the possibility of an "uncanny valley of mind" Accordingly people might experience strong feelings of aversion if they encounter highly advanced emotionsensitive technology Among the possible explanations for this phenomenon both a perceived loss of human uniqueness and expectations of immediate physical harm are discussed by contemporary research

Research
File:Uncanny valleypngA series of studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist for static images of robot faces Mathur MB & Reichling DB used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very humanlike: first a sample of 80 objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches and second a morphometrically and graphically controlled 6face series set of faces They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face To measure trust toward each face subjects completed a oneshot investment game to indirectly measure how much money they were willing to "wager" on a robots trustworthiness Both stimulus sets showed a robust uncanny valley effect on explicitlyrated likability and a more contextdependent uncanny valley on implicitlyrated trust Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the uncanny valley perceptual confusion at a category boundary found that category confusion occurs in the uncanny valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses

One study conducted in 2009 examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley A group of five monkeys were shown three images: two different 3D&nbsp;monkey faces (realistic unrealistic) and a real photo of a monkeys face The monkeys eyegaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion Since the realistic 3D&nbsp;monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo or the unrealistic 3D&nbsp;monkey face this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic 3D&nbsp;face aversive or otherwise preferred the other two images As one would expect with the uncanny valley more realism can lead to less positive reactions and this study demonstrated that neither humanspecific cognitive processes nor human culture explain the uncanny valley In other words this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin

 researchers at University of California San Diego and California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology were measuring human brain activations related to the uncanny valley In one study using Functional magnetic resonance imaging
Viewer perception of facial expression and speech and the uncanny valley in realistic humanlike characters intended for video games and film is being investigated by Tinwell et al 2011 Consideration is also given by Tinwell et al (2010) as to how the uncanny may be exaggerated for antipathetic characters in survival horror games Building on the body of work already undertaken in android science this research intends to build a conceptual framework of the uncanny valley using 3D characters generated in a realtime gaming engine The goal is to analyze how crossmodal factors of facial expression and speech can exaggerate the uncanny Tinwell et al 2011 have also introduced the notion of an unscalable uncanny wall that suggests that a viewers discernment for detecting imperfections in realism will keep pace with new technologies in simulating realism A summary of Angela Tinwells research on the uncanny valley psychological reasons behind the uncanny valley and how designers may overcome the uncanny in humanlike virtual characters is provided in her book The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation by CRC Press

Design principles
A number of design principles have been proposed for avoiding the uncanny valley:
 Design elements should match in human realism A robot may look uncanny when human and nonhuman elements are mixed For example both a robot with a synthetic voice or a human being with a human voice have been found to be less eerie than a robot with a human voice or a human being with a synthetic voice For a robot to give a more positive impression its degree of human realism in appearance should also match its degree of human realism in behavior If an animated character looks more human than its movement this gives a negative impression Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important
 Reducing conflict and uncertainty by matching appearance behavior and ability In terms of performance if a robot looks too appliancelike people expect little from it; if it looks too human people expect too much from it
 Human facial proportions and photorealistic texture should only be used together A photorealistic human texture demands human facial proportions or the computer generated character can fall into the uncanny valley Abnormal facial proportions including those typically used by artists to enhance attractiveness (eg&nbsp;larger eyes) can look eerie with a photorealistic human texture

Criticism
A number of criticisms have been raised concerning whether the uncanny valley exists as a unified phenomenon amenable to scientific scrutiny:
 The uncanny valley is a wikt:heterogeneous The uncanny valley may be generational Younger generations more used to Computergenerated imagery The uncanny valley is simply a specific case of information processing such as categorization and frequencybased effects In contrast to the assumption that the uncanny valley is based on a heterogeneous group of phenomena recent arguments have suggested that uncanny valleylike phenomena simply reflect the products of information processing such as categorization Cheetham et al have argued that the uncanny valley can be understood in terms of categorization processes with a category boundary defining the valley Extending this argument Burleigh and Schoenherr suggested that the effects associated with the uncanny valley can be divided into those attributable to the category boundary and individual exemplar frequency Namely the negative affective responses attributed to the uncanny valley were simply a result of the frequency of exposure similar to the mereexposure effect By varying the frequency of training items they were able to demonstrate a dissociation between cognitive uncertainty based on the category boundary and affective uncertainty based on the frequency of training exemplars In a followup study Schoenherr and Burleigh demonstrated that an instructional manipulation affected categorization accuracy but not ratings of negative affect Thus generational effects and cultural artifacts can be accounted for with basic information processing mechanisms These and related findings have been used to argue that the uncanny valley is merely an artifact of having greater familiarity with members of human categories and does not reflect a unique phenomenon
 The uncanny valley appears at any degree of human likeness Hanson has also pointed out that uncanny entities may appear anywhere in a spectrum ranging from the abstract (eg&nbsp;MITs robot Lazlo) to the perfectly human (eg&nbsp;cosmetically atypical people) This supports the view that the uncanny valley could arise due to issues of categorical perception that are particular to the way the brain processes information
 Good design can lift humanlooking entities out of the uncanny valley David Hanson (robotics designer)
Similar effects
If the uncanny valley is the result of general cognitive processes there should be evidence in evolutionary history and cultural artifacts An effect similar to the uncanny valley was noted by Charles Darwin in 1839:



A similar "uncanny valley" effect could according to the ethicalfuturist writer Jamais Cascio show up when humans begin modifying themselves with transhuman enhancements (cf body modification) which aim to improve the abilities of the human body beyond what would normally be possible be it eyesight muscle strength or cognition<ref nameopenthefuture>Cite web

In visual effects
A number of films that use computergenerated imagery to show characters have been described by reviewers as giving a feeling of revulsion or "creepiness" as a result of the characters looking too realistic Examples include the following:

 According to roboticist Dario Floreano the baby character Billy in Pixars groundbreaking 1988 animated short film Tin Toy provoked negative audience reactions which first led the film industry to take the concept of the uncanny valley seriously
 The 2001 film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within the first photorealistic computeranimated feature film provoked negative reactions from some viewers due to its nearrealistic yet imperfect visual depictions of human characters<ref>cite web Several reviewers of the 2004 animated film The Polar Express (film) In a review of the 2007 animated film Beowulf (2007 film) Some reviewers of the 2009 animated film A Christmas Carol (2009 film) The 2011 animated film Mars Needs Moms was widely criticized for being creepy and unnatural because of its style of animation The film was among the List of box office bombs Reviewers had mixed opinions regarding whether the 2011 animated film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn was affected by the uncanny valley Daniel D Snyder of The Atlantic wrote "Instead of trying to bring to life Herges beautiful artwork Spielberg and co have opted to bring the movie into the 3D era using trendy motioncapture technique to recreate Tintin and his friends Tintins original face while barebones never suffered for a lack of expression Its now outfitted with an alien and unfamiliar visage his plastic skin dotted with pores and subtle wrinkles" He added "In bringing them to life Spielberg has made the characters dead" NB of The Economist called elements of the animation "grotesque" writing "Tintin Captain Haddock and the others exist in settings that are almost photorealistic and nearly all of their features are those of fleshandblood people And yet they still have the sausage fingers and distended noses of comicstrip characters Its not so much The Secret of the Unicorn as The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" However other reviewers felt that the film avoided the uncanny valley despite its animated characters realism Critic Dana Stevens (critic) In the French film Animal Kingdom: Lets Go Ape it uses motion capture the apes were criticized for looking creepy As this review points out they have "weirdly humanoid figures" and "recognisably human faces"
 The 2019 film The Lion King (2019 film) The 2020 film Sonic the Hedgehog (film)  Multiple commentators cited the CGI halfhuman halfcat characters in the 2019 movie Cats (2019 film) In the 2022 Disney animated film Chip n Dale: Rescue Rangers (film) In the 2022 Disney+ series SheHulk: Attorney at Law the appearance of the main character SheHulk who is depicted via CGI was criticized by some reviewers as belonging in the uncanny valley and negatively compared to the appearance of the Hulk in the same series

Virtual actors
An increasingly common practice is to feature virtual actors in films: CGI likenesses of real actors used because the original actor either looks too old for the part or is deceased Sometimes a virtual actor is created with involvement from the original actor (who may contribute motion capture audio etc) while at other times the actor has no involvement Reviewers have often criticized the use of virtual actors for its uncanny valley effect saying it adds an eerie feeling to the movie Examples of virtual actors that have received such criticism include replicas of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation (2009) and Terminator Genisys (2015) Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy (2010) Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher in Rogue One (2016) and Will Smith in Gemini Man (film)
The use of virtual actors is in contrast with deaging in film
Deepfake software which first began to be widely used in 2017 uses machine learning to graft one persons facial expressions onto anothers appearance thus providing an alternate approach to both creating virtual actors and digital deaging Various individuals have created web videos that use deepfake software to recreate some of the notable previous uses of virtual actors and deaging in film Journalists have tended to praise these deepfake imitations calling them "more naturalistic" and "objectively better" than the originals
