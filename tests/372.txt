File:CoverOfWhatComputersCantDojpgHubert Dreyfus was a critic of artificial intelligence research In a series of papers and books including Alchemy and AI 
Dreyfus argued that human intelligence and expertise depend primarily on unconscious processes rather than conscious physical symbol system
When Dreyfus ideas were first introduced in the mid1960s they were met with ridicule and outright hostility By the 1980s however many of his perspectives were rediscovered by researchers working in robotics and the new field of connectionism—approaches now called "Artificial intelligenceSubsymbolic
 Dreyfus critique 
 The grandiose promises of artificial intelligence 

In Alchemy and AI  A computer would be world champion in chess
 A computer would discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem
 Most theories in psychology will take the form of computer programs
The press reported these predictions in glowing reports of the imminent arrival of machine intelligence

Dreyfus felt that this optimism was unwarranted and based on false assumptions about the nature of human intelligence Pamela McCorduck explains Dreyfus position:
<blockquote>A great misunderstanding accounts for public confusion about thinking machines a misunderstanding perpetrated by the unrealistic claims researchers in AI have been making claims that thinking machines are already here or at any rate just around the corner</blockquote>

These predictions were based on the success of an "information processing" model of the mind articulated by Newell and Simon in their physical symbol systems hypothesis and later expanded into a philosophical position known as computationalism by philosophers such as Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam Believing that they had successfully simulated the essential process of human thought with simple programs it seemed a short step to producing fully intelligent machines However Dreyfus argued that philosophy especially 20thcentury philosophy had discovered serious problems with this information processing viewpoint The mind according to modern philosophy is nothing like a digital computer

 Dreyfus four assumptions of artificial intelligence research 

In Alchemy and AI and What Computers Cant Do Dreyfus identified four philosophical assumptions that supported the faith of early AI researchers that human intelligence depended on the manipulation of symbols "In each case" Dreyfus writes "the assumption is taken by workers in AI as an axiom guaranteeing results whereas it is in fact one hypothesis among others to be tested by the success of such work"

;The biological assumption: The brain processes information in discrete operations by way of some biological equivalent of on/off switches

In the early days of research into neurology scientists realized that neurons fire in allornothing pulses Several researchers such as Walter Pitts and Warren Sturgis McCullochWhen digital computers became widely used in the early 50s this argument was extended to suggest that the brain was a vast physical symbol system manipulating the binary symbols of zero and one Dreyfus was able to refute the biological assumption by citing research in neurology that suggested that the action and timing of neuron firing had analog components But Daniel Crevier observes that "few still held that belief in the early 1970s and nobody argued against Dreyfus" about the biological assumption

;The psychological assumption: The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules

He refuted this assumption by showing that much of what we "know" about the world consists of complex attitudes or tendencies that make us lean towards one interpretation over another He argued that even when we use explicit symbols we are using them against an unconscious background of commonsense knowledge and that without this background our symbols cease to mean anything This background in Dreyfus view was not implemented in individual brains as explicit individual symbols with explicit individual meanings

;The epistemological assumption: All knowledge can be formalized

This concerns the philosophical issue of epistemology or the study of knowledge  Even if we agree that the psychological assumption is false AI researchers could still argue (as AI founder John McCarthy (computer scientist)
;The ontological assumption: The world consists of independent facts that can be represented by independent symbols

Hubert Dreyfus
 Knowinghow vs knowingthat: the primacy of intuition 

In Mind Over Machine 
Dreyfus argued that human problem solving and expertise depend on our background sense of the context of what is important and interesting given the situation rather than on the process of searching through combinations of possibilities to find what we need Dreyfus would describe it in 1986 as the difference between "knowingthat" and "knowinghow" based on Heideggers distinction of presentathand and readytohand

Knowingthat is our conscious stepbystep problem solving abilities We use these skills when we encounter a difficult problem that requires us to stop step back and search through ideas one at time At moments like this the ideas become very precise and simple: they become context free symbols which we manipulate using logic and language These are the skills that Allen Newell
Knowinghow on the other hand is the way we deal with things normally We take actions without using conscious symbolic reasoning at all as when we recognize a face drive ourselves to work or find the right thing to say We seem to simply jump to the appropriate response without considering any alternatives This is the essence of expertise Dreyfus argued: when our intuitions have been trained to the point that we forget the rules and simply "size up the situation" and react

The human sense of the situation according to Dreyfus is based on our goals our bodies and our culture—all of our unconscious intuitions attitudes and knowledge about the world This “context” or "background" (related to Heideggers Dasein) is a form of knowledge that is not stored in our brains symbolically but intuitively in some way It affects what we notice and what we dont notice what we expect and what possibilities we dont consider: we discriminate between what is essential and inessential The things that are inessential are relegated to our "fringe consciousness" (borrowing a phrase from William James): the millions of things were aware of but were not really thinking about right now 

Hubert Dreyfus
 History 

Dreyfus began to formulate his critique in the early 1960s while he was a professor at MIT then a hotbed of artificial intelligence research His first publication on the subject is a halfpage objection to a talk given by Herbert A Simon in the spring of 1961 Dreyfus was especially bothered as a philosopher that AI researchers seemed to believe they were on the verge of solving many long standing philosophical problems within a few years using computers

 "Alchemy and AI" 
In 1965 Dreyfus was hired (with his brother Stuart Dreyfus help) by Paul Armer to spend the summer at RAND Corporations Santa Monica facility where he would write "Alchemy and AI" the first salvo of his attack Armer had thought he was hiring an impartial critic and was surprised when Dreyfus produced a scathing paper intended to demolish the foundations of the field  (Armer stated he was unaware of Dreyfus previous publication) Armer delayed publishing it but ultimately realized that "just because it came to a conclusion you didnt like was no reason not to publish it" It finally came out as RAND Memo and soon became a best seller

The paper flatly ridiculed AI research comparing it to alchemy: a misguided attempt to change metals to gold based on a theoretical foundation that was no more than mythology and wishful thinking It ridiculed the grandiose predictions of leading AI researchers predicting that there were limits beyond which AI would not progress and intimating that those limits would be reached soon

 Reaction 
The paper "caused an uproar" according to Pamela McCorduck The AI communitys response was derisive and personal Seymour Papert dismissed one third of the paper as "gossip" and claimed that every quotation was deliberately taken out of context Herbert A Simon accused Dreyfus of playing "politics" so that he could attach the prestigious RAND name to his ideas Simon said "what I resent about this was the RAND name attached to that garbage"

Dreyfus who taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
The paper was the subject of a short in The New Yorker magazine on June 11 1966 The piece mentioned Dreyfus contention that while computers may be able to play checkers no computer could yet play a decent game of chess It reported with wry humor (as Dreyfus had) about the victory of a tenyearold over the leading chess program  with "even more than its usual smugness"

In hope of restoring AIs reputation Seymour Papert arranged a chess match between Dreyfus and Richard Greenblatt (programmer): "A Ten Year Old Can Beat the Machine— Dreyfus: But the Machine Can Beat Dreyfus"
Dreyfus complained in print that he hadnt said a computer will never play chess to which Herbert A Simon replied: "You should recognize that some of those who are bitten by your sharptoothed prose are likely in their human weakness to bite back  may I be so bold as to suggest that you could well begin the coolinga recovery of your sense of humor being a good first step"

 Vindicated 
By the early 1990s several of Dreyfus radical opinions had become mainstream

Failed predictions As Dreyfus had foreseen the grandiose predictions of early AI researchers failed to come true Fully intelligent machines (now known as "Artificial general intelligence
The biological assumption although common in the forties and early fifties was no longer assumed by most AI researchers by the time Dreyfus published What Computers Cant Do Although many still argue that it is essential to reverseengineer the brain by simulating the action of neurons (such as Ray Kurzweil or Jeff Hawkins) they dont assume that neurons are essentially digital but rather that the action of analog neurons can be simulated by digital machines to a reasonable level of accuracy (Alan Turing had made this same observation as early as 1950)

The psychological assumption and unconscious skills Many AI researchers have come to agree that human reasoning does not consist primarily of highlevel symbol manipulation In fact since Dreyfus first published his critiques in the 60s AI research in general has moved away from symbolic AI
In the 1980s these new "subsymbolic" approaches included: 
 Computational intelligence paradigms such as neural nets evolutionary algorithms and so on are mostly directed at simulated unconscious reasoning  Dreyfus himself agrees that these subsymbolic methods can capture the kind of "tendencies" and "attitudes" that he considers essential for intelligence and expertise
 Research into commonsense knowledge has focused on reproducing the "background" or context of knowledge
 Robotics researchers like Hans Moravec and Rodney Brooks were among the first to realize that unconscious skills would prove to be the most difficult to reverse engineer (See Moravecs paradox)  Brooks would spearhead a movement in the late 80s that took direct aim at the use of highlevel symbols called Nouvelle AI The situated movement in robotics research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention

In the 1990s and the early decades of the 21st century AIStatistical learning
This research has gone forward without any direct connection to Dreyfus work

Knowinghow and knowingthat Research in psychology and economics has been able to show that Dreyfus (and Heideggers) speculation about the nature of human problem solving was essentially correct Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky collected a vast amount of hard evidence that human beings use two very different methods to solve problems which they named "system 1" and "system 2" System one also known as the  adaptive unconscious is fast intuitive and unconscious System 2 is slow logical and deliberate Their research was collected in the book Thinking Fast and Slow and inspired Malcolm Gladwells popular book Blink (book)
Ignored
Although clearly AI research has come to agree with Dreyfus McCorduck claimed that "my impression is that this progress has taken place piecemeal and in response to tough given problems and owes nothing to Dreyfus"

The AI community with a few exceptions chose not to respond to Dreyfus directly "Hes too silly to take seriously" a researcher told Pamela McCorduck Marvin Minsky said of Dreyfus (and the other critiques coming from philosophy) that "they misunderstand and should be ignored" When Dreyfus expanded Alchemy and AI to book length and published it as What Computers Cant Do in 1972 no one from the AI community chose to respond (with the exception of a few critical reviews) McCorduck asks "If Dreyfus is so wrongheaded why havent the artificial intelligence people made more effort to contradict him?"

Part of the problem was the kind of philosophy that Dreyfus used in his critique Dreyfus was an expert in continental philosophy
Another problem was that he claimed (or seemed to claim) that AI would never be able to capture the human ability to understand context situation or purpose in the form of rules But (as Peter Norvig and Stuart J Russell
A more serious issue was the impression that Dreyfus critique was incorrigibly hostile McCorduck wrote "His derisiveness has been so provoking that he has estranged anyone he might have enlightened And thats a pity" Daniel Crevier stated that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfuss comments Had he formulated them less aggressively constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier"
