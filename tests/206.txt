Harley Farnsworth MacNair  (b 22 July 1891 Greenfields Pennsylvania d Chicago 22 June 1947) was a scholar and academic specialist in the modern international relations of East Asia After graduation from University of Redlands he taught first at St Johns University Shanghai
Family and early life
MacNair was born in Greenfields Pennsylvania the son of Douglad Evander MacNair and Nettie Adelia Farnsworth MacNair  He was among the first students in the University of Redlands an interdenominational university founded by Baptists in Redlands California
His Berkeley doctoral dissertation was published in Shanghai as The Chinese Abroad: Their Position and Protection (1924) He came to the United States to spend his furlough of 1927–1928 at University of Washington and the summer of 1928 at University of Chicago  He and his mother moved their household goods to Chicago but MacNair was not at first inclined to accept the offer of an ongoing position there He returned to St Johns and did not leave that position until 1931  and returned the next year to work with refugees in North China 

Perhaps the most important factor in overcoming his reluctance to leave St Johns for Chicago was the urging of Florence Wheelock Ayscough (18781942) a writer and a translator of Chinese poetry Born in Shanghai she lived in China until she was eleven She and MacNair first met in 1916 and the two immediately became fast friends He later wrote that "Tea" with her "was an occasion for the exchange of ideas with friends around a fire or in a garden" But after she and her husband left Shanghai she met MacNair again in 1929 when she told him of her belief that his work in China was done She said that Chicago was a better chance as he later recalled to "reverse what I had long been doing in China: help the West to understand the East" He took his mother to meet her in 1931 Her  husband died in 1935 and she and MacNair married September 7 1935 Their home in Chicago became the gathering place for persons concerned with China

Professional life and career
Modern Chinese History: Selected Readings a twovolume compilation of some 400 excerpts of documents and writings chosen to be assigned along with HB Morses The International Relations of the Chinese Empire in his course at St Johns  The selection was aimed to give sources of the "thoughts the customs and the deeds of those who made history" MacNair went on to condense Morses three volumes into Far Eastern International Relations (1928) coauthored with Morse which he finished in 1927 as he and other St Johns faculty were standing guard in expectation of armed uprisings to welcome Northern Expedition
The Chinese Abroad: Their Position and Protection published in 1927 surveyed the modern experience of Overseas Chinese The prominent Chinese diplomat Gu Weijun
The 1929 Far Eastern International Relations which he and HB Morse wrote was based on Morses  The International Relations of the Chinese Empire One reviewer praised their "abundant narrative" and contrasted their approach with other histories that gave only sketchy outlines and chapterbychapter bibliographies and that focused on international relations and give only enough internal political history to explain them The review praised MacNairs additions to Morse such as the description of the events of 1925–1927 which led to suppression of the Shanghai printing of the volume

In the spring of 1930 MacNair gave a series of lectures to the public at University of Chicago which he revised and published with University of Chicago Press in 1931 as China in Revolution: An Analysis of Politics and Militarism Arthur Holcombe

In the 1930s especially after his marriage to Florence Ayscough his interests turned away from international relations and political conditions and from professional scholarship During World War II however he was a staff member of the University of Chicago Civil Affairs Training School where the views he presented were sometimes in conflict with American government policies His last major publication was an edited symposium China which gathered essays mainly on culture and  history 

He did not however undertake the study of the Chinese language although he admired it tremendously and did not use Chinese language in his research feeling that he did not have the time for both this study and his extensive professional obligations
