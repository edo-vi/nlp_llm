Chickenblood therapy was a form of pseudomedical therapy popular in China during the Cultural Revolution It was practised mainly by village doctors in the 1960s It has been banned for official use by the government since July 1965

Therapy
The therapy consisted of weekly injections of dozens to a hundred millilitres fresh blood extracted from chicken preferably young cocks either Intravenous therapy
It was said that the therapy enabled the entry of certain proteins into the body to elicit an immune response but this claim was quickly determined to be a gross exaggeration Other problems with the therapy immediately became apparent such as infection and even death from poor chicken blood quality and a lack of purity control

Government attitude
After learning of chickenblood therapy the Government of China initially banned the therapy; Premier Zhou Enlai reportedly said that “The Central Ministry of Health’s handling of chicken blood therapy is a violation of Mao Zedong Thought” However in 1967 the ban was lifted as part of the Cultural Revolution Red Guards (China)
