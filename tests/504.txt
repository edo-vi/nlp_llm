The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia—the use of two distinct varieties of the same language usually in different social contexts Educated Arabic speakers are usually able to communicate in MSA in formal situations This diglossic situation facilitates codeswitching in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two varieties of the language sometimes even within the same sentence In instances in which highly educated Arabicspeakers of different nationalities engage in conversation but find their dialects mutually unintelligible (eg a Moroccan speaking with a Kuwaiti) they are able to code switch into MSA for the sake of communication
