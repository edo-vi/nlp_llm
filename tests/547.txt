Fee splitting is the practice of sharing fees with professional colleagues such as physicians or lawyers in return for being sent referrals

Fee splitting in medicine and healthcare

This is essentially the payment of a commission to the referrer with the express intention of ensuring that the referring doctor directs referrals of patients to the payee

In most parts of the world the practice is considered unethical and unacceptable hence fee splitting is often covert  The reason it is believed not to be in the interests of patients is because it represents a conflict of interest which may adversely affect patient care and wellbeing since patients will not necessarily be referred to the most appropriate doctor to provide their ongoing care but will instead be referred to those doctors or hospitals with whom the referring doctor has a "fee splitting" or commission payment type of arrangement It is also called as CUT (also spoken as CeeYouTee) practice in many parts of the world including India for its reference to a cut from the patients bill

Many countries do not allow promotion of health services via mass media advertisements and other direct promotions and in a significant way information on pricing and quality of care institutions and medicines reaches to patient through their primary care physician many of whom indulge in a referral fee split unethical practice to refer a patient for business to a higher specialist brand prescription and admissions

Fee splitting in the United States

The situation in the US is not entirely clear

According to the World Medical Association

<blockquote>The American Medical Association
Among its Definitions of Unprofessional Conduct the "West Hudson Psychiatric Society Virtual Newsletter" (1997) lists "Offering giving or receiving a fee for the referral of a patient (fee splitting) or permitting any person other than an employee or associate to share in your fee who has not provided an appropriate service directly under your supervision"

However the practice or something resembling it tends to be tolerated â€“ in Medicine Money and Morals: Physicians Conflicts of Interest by Marc A Rodwin forms of fee splitting and commission paying for referrals remain common in the US and are in effect tolerated by key overseeing bodies such as the American Medical Association and Joint Commission International or JCI

According to their website the Joint Commission (JCI) have no published view on the issue of fee splitting and in fact the Joint Commission stopped trying to provide guidance on medical ethics to American hospitals many years ago preferring to concentrate on less challenging areas of healthcare assessment despite the vast importance of medical ethics to patient safety  It is not clear if JCI operate to a similar level of standards when working outside of the US

The popular group marketing website Groupon and other daily deal businesses have received the green light from some US state bar associations most notably North Carolina State Bar
