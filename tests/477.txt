Stylistics a branch of applied linguistics is the study and language interpretation
As a discipline stylistics links literary criticism to linguistics It does not function as an autonomous domain on its own and it can be applied to an understanding of literature and journalism as well as linguistics Sources of study in stylistics may range from canonical works of writing to popular texts and from advertising copy to news nonfiction and pop culture
Stylistics as a conceptual discipline may attempt to establish principles capable of explaining particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language such as in the literary production and reception of genre the study of folk art in the study of spoken dialects and register (sociolinguistics)
Plain language has different features
Common stylistic features are using dialogue regional accent (sociolinguistics)
Early twentieth century
The analysis of literary style goes back to the study of rhetoric
In 1909 Charles Bally proposed stylistics as a distinct academic discipline to complement Ferdinand de Saussure
Taking forward the ideas of the Russian Formalists the Prague School built on the concept of foregrounding where it is assumed that poetic language is considered to stand apart from nonliterary background language by means of  deviation (from the norms of everyday language) or Parallelism (rhetoric)
Late twentieth century
Roman Jakobson had been an active member of the Russian Formalists and the Prague School before emigrating to America in the 1940s He brought together Russian Formalism and American New Criticism in his Closing Statement at a conference on stylistics at Indiana University in 1958 Published as Linguistics and Poetics in 1960 Jakobsons lecture is often credited with being the first coherent formulation of stylistics and his argument was that the study of poetic language should be a subbranch of linguistics The poetic function was one of six general Jakobsons functions of language
Michael Halliday is an important figure in the development of British stylistics His 1971 study Linguistic Function and Literary Style: An Inquiry into the Language of William Goldings The Inheritors is a key essay One of Hallidays contributions has been the use of the term Register (sociolinguistics)
Fowler comments that different fields produce different language most obviously at the level of vocabulary (Fowler 1996 192) The linguist David Crystal points out that Hallidays tenor stands as a roughly equivalent term for style which is a more specific alternative used by linguists to avoid ambiguity (Crystal 1985 292) Hallidays third category mode is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written spoken and so on but also describes the genre of the text (Downes 1998 316) Halliday refers to genre as precoded language language that has not simply been used before but that predetermines the selection of textual meanings The linguist William Downes makes the point that the principal characteristic of register no matter how peculiar or diverse is that it is obvious and immediately recognisable (Downes 1998 309)

Literary stylistics
In The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language Crystal observes that in practice most stylistic analysis has attempted to deal with the complex and valued language within literature ie literary stylistics He goes on to say that in such examination the scope is sometimes narrowed to concentrate on the more striking features of literary language for instance its deviant and abnormal features rather than the broader structures that are found in whole texts or discourses For example the compact language of poetry is more likely to reveal the secrets of its construction to the stylistician than is the language of plays and novels (Crystal 1987 71)

Poetry
As well as conventional styles of language there are the unconventional â€“ the most obvious of which is poetry In Practical Stylistics Henry Widdowson:His memory is dear today
:As in the hour he passed away
:(Ernest C Draper Ern Died 4138)
:(Widdowson 1992 6)

Widdowson makes the point that such sentiments are usually not very interesting and suggests that they may even be dismissed as crude verbal carvings and crude verbal disturbance (Widdowson 3) Nevertheless Widdowson recognises that they are a very real attempt to convey feelings of human loss and preserve affectionate recollections of a beloved friend or family member However what may be seen as poetic in this language is not so much in the formulaic phraseology but in where it appears The verse may be given undue reverence precisely because of the sombre situation in which it is placed Widdowson suggests that unlike words set in stone in a graveyard poetry is unorthodox language that vibrates with intertextual implications (Widdowson 1992 4)

Two problems with a stylistic analysis of poetry are noted by PM Wetherill in Literary Text: An Examination of Critical Methods The first is that there may be an overpreoccupation with one particular feature that may well minimise the significance of others that are equally important (Wetherill 1974 133) The second is that any attempt to see a text as simply a collection of stylistic elements will tend to ignore other ways whereby meaning is produced (Wetherill 1974 133)

Implicature
In Poetic Effects from Literary Pragmatics the Linguistics
Pilkingtons poetic effects as he terms the concept are those that achieve most relevance through a wide array of weak implicatures and not those meanings that are simply read in by the hearer or reader Yet the distinguishing instant at which weak implicatures and the hearer or readers conjecture of meaning diverge remains highly subjective As Pilkington says: there is no clear cutoff point between assumptions which the speaker certainly endorses and assumptions derived purely on the hearers responsibility (Pilkington 1991 53) In addition the stylistic qualities of poetry can be seen as an accompaniment to Pilkingtons poetic effects in understanding a poems meaning

Tense
Widdowson points out that in Samuel Taylor Coleridges poem "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (1798) the mystery of the Mariners abrupt appearance is sustained by an idiosyncratic use of tense (Widdowson 1992 40) For instance the Mariner holds the weddingguest with his skinny hand in the present tense but releases it in the past tense (his hands dropt he); only to hold him again this time with his glittering eye in the present (Widdowson 1992 41)

The point of poetry
Widdowson notices that when the content of poetry is summarised it often refers to very general and unimpressive observations such as nature is beautiful; love is great; life is lonely; time passes and so on (Widdowson 1992 9) But to say:<br>
:Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
:So do our minutes hasten to their end 
:William Shakespeare 60
Or indeed:<br>
:Love all alike no season knows nor clime
:Nor hours days months which are the rags of time 
:John Donne The Sun Rising (poem)This language gives the reader a new perspective on familiar themes and allows us to look at them without the personal or social conditioning that we unconsciously associate with them (Widdowson 1992 9) So although the reader may still use the same exhausted words and vague terms like love heart and soul to refer to human experience to place these words in a new and refreshing context allows the poet the ability to represent humanity and communicate honestly This in part is stylistics and this according to Widdowson is the point of poetry (Widdowson 1992 76)
