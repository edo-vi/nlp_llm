Parent management training (PMT) also known as behavioral parent training (BPT) or simply parent training is a family of treatment programs that aims to change parenting behaviors teaching parents positive reinforcement methods for improving preschool and schoolage childrens behavior problems (such as aggression hyperactivity tantrum
PMT is one of the most investigated treatments available for disruptive behavior particularly oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD); it is effective in reducing child disruptive behavior and improving parental mental health  PMT has also been studied as a treatment for disruptive behaviors in children with other conditions  Limitations of the existing research on PMT include a lack of knowledge on mechanisms of change and the absence of studies of longterm outcomes PMT may be more difficult to implement when parents are unable to participate fully due to psychopathology limited cognitive capacity high partner conflict or inability to attend weekly sessions

PMT was initially developed in the 1960s by child psychologists who studied changing childrens disruptive behaviors by intervening to change parent behaviors The model was inspired by principles of operant conditioning and applied behavioral analysis Treatment which typically lasts for several months focuses on parents learning to provide positive reinforcement such as praise and rewards for childrens appropriate behaviors while setting proper limits using methods such as removing attention for inappropriate behaviors

 Technique 
Poor parenting inadequate parental supervision discipline that is not consistent and parental mental health status stress or substance abuse all contribute to earlyonset conduct problems; the resulting costs to society are high Negative parenting practices and negative child behavior contribute to one another in a "coercive cycle" in which one person begins by using a negative behavior to control the other persons behavior That person in turn responds with a negative behavior and the negative exchange escalates until one persons negative behavior "wins" the battle For example if a child throws a temper tantrum to avoid doing a chore the parent may respond by yelling that the child must do it to which the child responds by tantruming even louder at which point the parent may give in to the child to avoid further disruption The childs tantrums are thereby reinforced; by throwing a tantrum she/he has achieved the end goal of getting out of the chore PMT seeks to break patterns that reinforce negative behavior by instead teaching parents to reinforce positive behaviors

The content of PMT as well as the sequencing of skills within the training varies according to the approach being used In most PMT parents are taught to define and record observations of their childs behavior both positive and negative; this may involve the use of a progress chart This monitoring procedure provides useful information for the parents and therapist to set specific goals for treatment and to measure the childs progress over time Parents learn to give specific concise instructions using eye contact while speaking in a calm manner

Providing positive reinforcement for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of PMT Typically parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise smiles and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child) In addition parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called "successive approximations")

PMT also teaches parents to appropriately set limits using structured techniques in response to their childs negative behavior The different ways in which parents are taught to respond to positive versus negative behavior in children is sometimes referred to as differential reinforcement For mildly annoying but not dangerous behavior parents practice ignoring the behavior Following unwanted behavior parents are also introduced to the proper use of the timeout (parenting)
In addition to positive reinforcement and limit setting in the home many PMT programs incorporate collaboration with the childs teacher to track behavior in school and link it to the reward program at home Another common element of many PMT programs is preparing parents to manage problem behaviors in situations that are typically difficult for the child such as being in a public place

The training is usually delivered by therapists (psychologists or social workers) to individual families or groups of families and is conducted primarily with the parents rather than the child although children can become involved as the therapist and parents see fit  with different programs ranging from 4 to 24 weekly sessions

PMT is underutilized and training for therapists and other providers has been limited; it has not been widely used outside of clinical and research settings

 Programs 

The theory behind PMT has been "repeatedly validated" and many programs have met the "goldstandard criteria for wellestablished interventions"  All of the established programs teach better parenting skills and emphasize that the parentchild relationship is "bidirectional"

Specific treatment programs that can be broadly characterized as PMT include parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT) Triple P (parenting program)
The per family cost of group parent training programs to bring an average child into a nonclinical range of behavioral disruption was estimated in 2013 to be US$2500 which according to the authors of a Cochrane review was "modest when compared with the longterm health social educational and legal costs associated with childhood conduct problems"

Effects

 Childhood disruptive behaviors 
PMT is one of the most extensively studied treatments for childhood disruptive behaviors PMT tended to have larger effects for younger children than older children although the differences between age groups were not statistically significant Improvement in parental mental health (depression stress irritability anxiety and sense of confidence) as well as parental behavior is noted  Improvements in child and parent behavior were maintained up to one year after PMT although the effects were small; very few studies have been done on the durability of the effects of PMT

Families from economically disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely to benefit from PMT than their more advantaged counterparts but this difference was attenuated if the lowincome families received individual rather than group treatment Overall group formats of PMT delivery were less effective than individual formats and the addition of individual therapy for the child did not improve outcomes  Parental psychopathology substance abuse and maternal depression are associated with less successful outcomes; this may be because the "parents ability to learn and consolidate the skills being taught" is affected or parents may not be able to stay engaged in the program or translate the skills acquired to the home

Furlong et al (2013) concluded that groupbased PMT is costeffective in reducing conduct problems and improving parental health and parenting skills but that there is not enough evidence that it is effective on the measures of "child emotional problems and educational and cognitive abilities"

 Other childhoodonset conditions 
Although the bulk of the research on PMT examines its impact on disruptive behavior it has also been studied as an intervention for other conditions

Conflict is high in families of children with attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with parents showing "more negative and ineffective parenting (eg power assertive punitive inconsistent) and less positive or warm parenting relative to parents of children without ADHD" PMT targets dysfunctional parenting and schoolrelated problems of children with ADHD such as work completion and peer problems This analysis also noted that the clinicians involved in these studies often modified the training based on the needs of the family This variation however did not create significant differences in effectiveness of PMT across studies  The authors concluded that there was a lack of data to evaluate school achievement and a risk of bias in the studies due to poor methodology; existing evidence was not strong enough to form clear clinical guidelines with regard to PMT for ADHD or to say whether group or individual PMT was more effective

A 2009 review of longterm outcomes in children with Tourette syndrome (TS) said that in those children with TS who have other comorbidity
The US National Institute of Mental Health has designated the "gap between evidencebased treatments and community services" as an area critically in need of more research; PMT for disruptive behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders is an area of ongoing research

 Limitations 
There is a great deal of support for PMT in the research literature but several limitations of the research have been noted A common concern with implementing evidencebased treatments in community (as opposed to research) contexts is that the robust effects found in clinical trials may not generalize to complex community populations and settings Increased attention to the impact of cultural diversity on PMT outcomes – especially given that parenting practices are deeply rooted in culture – was called for in the 1990s;  a 2013 review said the emphasis on ethnic and cultural differences was unjustified in terms of efficacy

Other limitations of the existing research is that studies tend to focus on statistically significant rather than clinically significant change (for example whether the childs daily functioning actually improves);  there is no data on longterm sustainability of treatment effects; and little is known about the processes or mechanisms through which PMT improves outcomes

Training programs other than PMT may be better indicated for "parents with significant psychopathology (such as anger management problems ADHD depression substance abuse) limited cognitive capacity or those
in highly conflicted marital/partner relationships" or those parents unlikely or unable to attend weekly sessions

History
Parent management training was developed in the early 1960s in response to an urgent need in American child guidance clinics Research across a national network of these clinics revealed that the treatments being used for young children with disruptive behaviors who constituted the majority of children served in these settings were largely ineffective Several child psychologists including Robert Wahler Constance Hanf Martha E Bernal and Gerald Patterson The early work of Hanf and Patterson hypothesized that "teaching parents the principles of behavioral reinforcement would result in effective sustainable change in child behavior" Patterson and colleagues theorized that adverse environmental contexts lead to disruptions in parent practices which then contribute to negative child outcomes

Following the initial development of PMT a second wave of research from 1975 to 1985 focused on the longerterm effects and generalization of treatment to settings other than the clinic (such as home or school) larger family effects (such as improved parenting with siblings) and behavioral improvements outside of the targeted areas (such as improved ability to make friends) Since 1985 the literature on PMT has continued to expand with researchers exploring such topics as application of the treatment to serious clinical problems dealing with client resistance to treatment prevention programs and implementation with diverse populations

Evidence in support of PMT has not always been rigorously examined;  future research should examine the effectiveness of PMT on the families most at risk address parental psychopathology as a factor in outcomes examine whether gains from PMT are maintained in the longterm and better account for variability in outcomes dependent on practices under "realworld" conditions
