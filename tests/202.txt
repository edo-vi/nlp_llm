A moral (from Latin morālis) is a message that is conveyed or a lesson to be learned from a narrative
Finding morals
As an example of an explicit maxim at the end of Aesops Fables
The use of stock characters is a means of conveying the moral of the story by eliminating complexity of personality and depicting the issues arising in the interplay between the characters enabling the writer to generate a clear message With more rounded characters such as those typically found in Shakespeares Play (theatre)
Arts
Throughout the history of recorded literature the majority of fictional writing has served not only to entertain but also to instruct inform or improve their audiences or readership In Ancient Greek theatre
Morals have typically been more obvious in childrens literature sometimes even being introduced with the phrase: "https://freemoralstoriesin/thelionandmousestorymoral/The moral of the story is …" Such explicit techniques have grown increasingly out of fashion in modern storytelling and are now usually only included for irony
Some examples are: "Better to be safe than sorry" (precautionary principle) "The evil deserves no aid" "Be friends with whom you dont like" "Dont judge people by the way they look" "Slow and steady wins the race" "Once started down the dark path forever will it hold your destiny" and "Your overconfidence is your weakness" Aesops Fables are the most famous of stories with strong moral conclusions

 Moral tales 
Morals were one of the main purposes of literature during 1780–1830 especially in childrens literature Part of the reason for this was the writings of John Locke and JeanJacques Rousseau in the 18th century which brought attention to children as an audience for literature Following in their line of thought Thomas Day (writer)
The ability of children to derive moral lessons from stories and visual media develops around the age of 9 or 10 years
