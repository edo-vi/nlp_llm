The Doubting Antiquity School or Yigupai () refers to a group of scholars and writers in Chinese language
Hu Shih studied in the West and was deeply influenced by Western thought He then argued in Peking University that Chinese written history was not credible before Eastern Zhou without critical examination This view was accepted by his students Fu Sinian and especially Gu Jiegang who further advanced "our traditional knowledge of Chinese antiquity was built up in successive strata but in an order exactly the reverse of the actual occurrence"

Most of their criticism concerns the authenticity of preQin texts and deals with questions put forward by the past dynastic writers as well as other subjects Hu Shih initiated the critical movement Their writings also had influence on many western sinologists including Bernhard Karlgren and Samuel B Griffith
In a more specific way the Doubting Antiquity School was represented by Gushibian 古史辨 (Debates on Ancient History) the scholarly movement led by Gu Jiegang centered on the magazine of the same name Seven issues of the magazine 1926–1941 contain about 350 essays

Major critics of the Doubting Antiquity School were historians associated with the The Critical Review (Chinese journal)
Evaluation
In the atmosphere of critical reevaluation of traditional culture and learnings of the early 20th century the Doubting Antiquity School found great influence Some of their conjectures cast doubt on the authenticity of historical narratives about Chinese antiquity as presented in traditional texts that have been accepted as authentic for millennia It is these conjectures that gained the greatest popular interest in the nonacademic media such as:
 Yu the Great was originally an animal or deity figure used as a motif on bronzeware and the veneration of bronzeware led to Yu being recast as a historical but superhuman figure from antiquity;
 the peaceful transition of power from Emperor Yao a series of early antiquity kings were concocted in the Han dynasty and Xin dynasty to justify the rule of those dynasties on geomancy grounds; and
 a portion of the recorded history of the Xia dynasty was concocted borrowing the narrative from real events in the Shang dynasty to give historical precedent to the "revival" of the Eastern Han dynasty

Nevertheless the Doubting Antiquity Schools more important legacy was the critical approach to sources they pioneered The central tenet of their approach was that the history of Chinese antiquity was created iteratively Ancient texts have been repeatedly edited reorganised tampered with or even completely fabricated so the historical narrative of antiquity as presented in traditional texts was different at different points of time As time went on the history of antiquity became longer and more complicated characters acquired more features including more supernatural attributes This means that it is not always possible to identify the "authentic" version of events from antiquity only the narrative as stated in a text at a particular time 

Some of the conjectures put forward by the Doubting Antiquity School are now disproved or supported based on archaeological findings undermining or supporting the authenticity of the historical texts that the Doubting Antiquity School posited as inauthentic Joseph Needham wrote in 1954 that many scholars doubted that classic texts such as Sima Qians Records of the Grand Historian contained accurate information about such distant history including the thirty kings of the Shang dynasty (c 1600–c 1046 BC) listed by Sima Many scholars argued that Sima could not have had access to written materials which detailed history a millennium before his time However the discovery of oracle bones at an excavation of the Shang capital at Anyang (Yinxu) matched 23 names of the 30 Shang kings listed by Sima Needham writes that this remarkable archaeological find proves that Sima Qian "did have fairly reliable materials at his disposal—a fact which underlines once more the deep historicalmindedness of the Chinese"

In 1993 scholar Li Xueqin made an influential speech in which he called for historians to "leave the Doubting Antiquity period" which became the manifesto of the "Believing Antiquity" movement (although Li himself favoured a third historiographical approach of "Interpreting Antiquity") Scholars of the "Believing Antiquity" viewpoint argue that archaeological discoveries of recent decades have generally substantiated Chinese traditional accounts rather than contradicted them rendering the doubts of the Doubting Antiquity School largely obsolete For instance manuscripts discovered in tombs have proved the authenticity of several texts long thought to be later forgeries including the Wenzi the Kongzi Jiayu the Heguanzi parts of the Yi Zhou Shu and many others

Criticism
The Doubting Antiquity Schools opinion and claims were not universally accepted by other schools in 1920s Major critics of the Doubting Antiquity School were historians from the Historiography and Geography School (史地學派) of the National Central University in Nanjing and the academics associated with the academic journal The Critical Review (Chinese journal)
These historians claimed that the many hypotheses of Doubting Antiquity School were radical and nationalist revisionisms influenced by the May Fourth Movement and New Culture Movement which aimed to abolish Chinese tradition And some claims of the Doubting Antiquity School such as SinoBabylonianism were based on assumption without any archaeological evidence Chinese writer Lu Xun dismissed Doubting Antiquity School and their publication Gushibian (古史辨 Debates on Ancient History) He argued that the real intention behind Doubting Antiquity School was to aggressively demolish the Chinese imperial legacy so much so that they would reject real historiography Much archaeological evidence discovered in 20th century such as Yinxu and Taosi proved some of the Doubting Antiquity Schools claims to be incorrect

Zhang Guoan of Beijing Normal University believes the existence of Doubting Antiquity School was a reflection of the political climate of rising Chinese nationalism at the time

Relationship with Chinese archaeology
The influence of Doubting Antiquity School caused many people to lose confidence in many ancient books and traditional ancient histories Driven by the special interest of Chinese people in history they turned to Chinese archaeology which was just born in order to gain a better understanding of Chinese ancient history The excavation of the ancient site of Yangshao culture
At this time the culture of the West was very clamorous and its influence was widespread The excavation of Yin Ruins in Anyang in 1928 brought the understanding and discussion of ancient history into a new stage The Yin Ruins have oracle bone inscriptions and their important content to confirm the lineage of the Shang Dynastys ancestors and kings recorded in "Records of the Grand Historian Yin Benji" as well as exquisite bronze wares stage In 1929 the sixth excavation of Yin Ruins in Anyang discovered a piece of painted pottery which further aroused the thinking and discussion of the relationship between Yangshao and Xiaotun

It can be said that modern Chinese archaeology was developed in order to seek the roots of Chinese culture under the Doubting Antiquity School about the authenticity of historical documents and the stimulation of "Western Origin"
