Dark Earth
In  geology and archaeology dark earth is a substratum (geology)Image:Scotland Skye Trotternishjpg
Londons dark earth was originally called black earth by archaeologists It was renamed dark earth because of confusion with the chernozem (black earth soils in Russia) whose dark colour is traditionally (not universally) thought to come from humus rather than soot

Charred material as agricultural improver
In the Hebrides it was customary to remove the thatch from the Blackhouse
 Major areas 

 Roman Britain 

In England dark earth covers many areas that were built up in the Roman period especially Londinium In some cases it may represent open spaces on the edge of urban centres but can also be found in more rural settings in and around foci of settlement In the example of London deposits underlying the ancient citys dark earth are often dated to between the 2nd to 5th century the middle and later Roman period Overlying deposits are frequently dated to the 9th century when Saxon London was repopulated and began to expand The dark earth shows little evidence of any depositional structure or horizons although Fill (archaeology)Tip lines
Archaeologists have debated what Londons dark earth layer may indicate about human use of the cityhttps://wwwcambridgeorg/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/futurefordarkearth/98B789261090F933CE176B4BF4F971E5 It has been taken as evidence of refuse disposal or gardening during the Roman period on the site of previous buildings In this case it might be evidence of a decline of Londiniums population or of its partial displacement outside the city walls However late Roman cemeteries around London do not show a population decline compared with earlier London

Alternatively dark earth might have formed only after abandonment at the end of the Roman period In this interpretation dark earth would consist of urban deposits of smokeimpregnated thatch decayed weeds timber and earth floors reworked and homogenized by worm action or by agricultural activities such as ploughing that mixed building materials from the abandoned Roman cities with material deposited later

Latest findings in France demonstrated that dark earth may originate from a change from stone to organic building materials; timber and straw will decay and build dark earth The presence of dark earth does not necessarily imply diminished human activity

 Sweden 
In Sweden dark earth covering  has been found in Uppåkra in Scania southern Sweden where a citylike settlement existed from about the year 1 until 1000 CE when the settlement shifted to modern day Lund Dark earth over  has been found in the Viking city of Birka
 West Africa 
Dark earths occur around ruins in the Upper Guinean forests of Ghana Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone For a period of at least 700 years West African farmers have enriched the rain forest soils around their towns with compost derived from kitchen animal agricultural and fire waste to produce a signature dark earth Dark earth is part of the local nomenclature economically important and is used judiciously by local communities The Loma people
