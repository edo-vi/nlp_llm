Ruminal tympany also known as ruminal bloat is a disease of ruminant animals characterized by an excessive volume of gas in the rumen Ruminal tympany may be primary known as frothy bloat or secondary known as freegas bloat

In the rumen food eaten by the ruminant is fermentation
In frothy bloat (primary ruminal tympany) the gas produced by fermentation is trapped within the fermenting material in the rumen causing a build up of foam which cannot be released by burping In cattle the disease may be triggered after an animal eats a large amount of easily fermenting plants such as legumes alfalfa red clover or white clover In feedlot cattle a diet containing a high proportion of cereal grain can lead to primary ruminal tympany The main signs of bloat in cattle are distension of the left side of the abdomen dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and severe distress If gas continues to accumulate the right side of the abdomen may also become distended with death occurring in cattle within 3–4 hours after symptoms begin

In freegas bloat (secondary ruminal tympany) gas builds up in the rumen and cannot escape due to blockage of the esophagus

Treatment
 Removal of gases through trocar or cannula
 Use stomach tube and remove the ruminal digesta
 Medi oral (antifoaming agent) 10ml+250ml warm water and drench to the animal If antifoaming agent not available vegetable oil can be used 400–500ml per large animal
 Sodium bicarbonate
 Nux vomica
 Antihistamine is used to avoid lameness One particular sign in acidosis is lameness Because lactic acid accumulates in the coronary band it causes irritation; histamine is released which causes lameness so antihistamine is used to avoid it

 Cultural depictions 
Thomas Hardys novel Far from the Madding Crowd depicts a flock of sheep suffering from bloat which are saved by shepherd Gabriel Oak using a trocar to release the gas
