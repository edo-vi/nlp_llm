Liberature is literature in which the material form is considered an important part of the whole and essential to understanding the work

 Description of liberature 

Liberature refers to a new kind of literature a Crossgenre
The demands posed by liberature shape a new kind of reader In traditional texts the reader empirically processes the text of a work in order to attain a desired level of understanding; one follows the steps of a model reader whose purpose is to bring oneself closer to ones virtual model Certain works diverge from this concept of linear textual reading such as those by Umberto Eco or Roland Barthes Such works introduce uncertainty into these structured expectations and programs of behavior Neither the works of Eco nor Barthes constitute liberature but they exemplify a difference in the quality of the programming of the readers experience

The printed works of liberature although diverse in the application share the following variables of the traversal function:


Only in several instances the work may breach the abovementioned scheme of characteristic variables of liberature In all other cases readers are responsible for configuring their reading of the text
Texts of liberature that generate multiple statements are not limited to literary works and definitely not to electronic texts – the category embraces computer games and other forms of both ergodic literatureIn permutative works – those in which the order of text is inconsequential  instead of static function defining the dynamics something else occurs  An intratextonic dynamic one that guides the reader throughout the text occurs The text is also not determinate meaning that it lacks a specificity which would hinder interpretation and different readings The ergodic character of the work is usually determined by the exploratory function of the reader
The parallel character of the works is written into the very core of liberature; the order in which the reader perceives the text governs the way the work is rendered The interactive capacity of the work becomes if not an aesthetic category a way of the readers behavior that is written into the text The work of liberature disrupts the structure of expectations based on a syntagmatic order as well as the strategies characteristic of a linear text The works of liberature refer to the experience of simultaneousness Furthermore liberature as a Crossgenre
 The creation of the concept Liberature avant la lettre 

In 1999 Zenon Fajfer postulated the genre of liberature to describe the yetundefinable work Okaleczenie that he and Katarzyna Bazarnik had been working on In a translated explanation of the concept Fajfer describes liberature as "a type or genre of literature in which the text is integrated with the physical space of the book into a meaningful whole and in which all elements (from the graphic ones to the kinds of paper (or other material) and the physical shape of the book) may contribute to its meaning" Fajfer specifically cites the necessity of creating the genre because he too often sees nontraditional literary works judged only as works of art but not as literature After conception the idea was developed by Katarzyna Bazarnik who basing her reflections on the analysis of the works by James Joyce demonstrated that the similarity of the text and the form creates iconicity By exploring and dynamically developing the study of iconicity a common feature of liberature Bazarnik contributed to the consideration of liberature in the literary community at large

Fajfers liberature is in no immediate denotational relation with various earlier uses of the word including the English legal synonym for “livery” the name of a program of Czech Radio and the term coined by Julián Ríos for the novel Larva (1983)

Considering liberature anachronistically it is noteworthy that writers began experimenting with literary forms as early as in the Baroque period The unusual structure of the works forces the readers to focus their attention to choose the beginning and the end of the text and – most importantly – form another level of Sign (semiotics)
In the 17th and 18th centuries word‐games (such as rebuses palindromes and anagrams) all of which date back to antiquity were employed  There were also text‐machines texts that after being programmed were able to generate new texts The similarity of various literary works from this period was a result of fashion but also of using the same Latin books on poetry and rhetoric in which creating elaborate poetry and later prose was one of the practice exercises

The works that may be considered liberature avant la lettre were penned by such writers as William blake
In Poland some of Radosław Nowakowskis works predated the coinage of the term Owing to discussions with Fajfer Nowakowski found the term useful and started considering himself a writer of liberature

One of Nowakowskis most prominent works is Ulica Sienkiewicza w Kielcach (Sienkiewicz Street in Kielce) published in 2002 
Another of Nowakowskis books Nieposkładana teoria sztuki (Noncompleted Theory of Art) first published in 1994 is composed of a pile of separate pages placed in a box which according to the author mirrors the "theory of puzzle with the exception that not all of the elements fit”
In the works where Nowakowski provides the reader with three versions of the text – Polish language

 Jonathan Safran Foer 

Liberature in the AngloSaxon countries is represented by Jonathan Safran Foer Foers hybrid postmodern novel Tree of Codes (2010) is an example of visual writing utilizing typesetting images spaces and blank pages to give the book a visual dimension beyond the prose narrative Foer has taken his favorite book The Street of Crocodiles by Bruno Schulz and used it as a canvas cutting into and out of the pages to arrive at an original new story In one interview the author emphasises that although the originality of the story brought to life in such an innovative way is a very compelling feature it was the form of the book that captivated him the most: “… I was more interested in subtracting than adding and also in creating a book with a threedimensional life On the brink of the end of paper I was attracted to the idea of a book that can’t forget it has a body"

 Liberature in other media 

Although the authors creating liberature frequently apply the traditional ways of publication (chiefly paper books) they also appreciate other possibilities Liberatic texts whose primary medium is the Internet are representative of eliberature


Other examples include Radosław Nowakowskis works such as the transformation of the hypertext model of the book by Nowakowski into Hala 1000 Ton set in the old Norblins factory (Warsaw) (2005) The project called Libro 2N was defined as a "journey into Blini
