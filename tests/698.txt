History


The work that became Records of the Grand Historian was begun by Sima Tan who was Grand Historian (  also translated "Grand Scribe") of the Han dynasty court during the late 2nd century Sima Tan drafted plans for the ambitious work and left behind some fragments and notes that may have been incorporated into the final text After his death in 110 the project was continued and completed by his son and successor Sima Qian who is generally credited as the works author The exact date of the Records completion is unknown But it is certain that Sima Qian completed it by ca 91 BC before his death in approximately 86 with one copy residing in the imperial capital of Changan (presentday Xian) and the other copy probably being stored in his home"

The original title of the work as given by the author in the postface is Taishigongshu () or Records of the Grand Historian although it was also known by a variety of other titles including Taishigongji () and Taishigongzhuan () in ancient times Eventually Shiji () or Historical Records became the most commonly used title in Chinese This title was originally used to refer to any general historical text although after the Three Kingdoms period Shiji gradually began to be used exclusively to refer to Sima Qians work In English the original title Records of the Grand Historian is in common use although Historical Records The Grand Scribes Records and Records of the Historian are also used

The history of the Records early reception and circulation is not well known Several 1stcentury BC authors such as the scholar Chu Shaosun (; fl 327) added interpolations to the Records These scholars may have had to reconstruct portions of the Records as ten of its original 130 chapters were lost in the Eastern Han period (AD 25220) and seem to have been reconstructed later

Beginning in the Northern and Southern dynasties (420589) and the Tang dynasty (618907) several scholars wrote and edited commentaries to the Records Most 2ndmillennium editions of the Records include the commentaries of Pei Yin ( 5th century) Sima Zhen (early 8th century) and Zhang Shoujie ( early 8th century) The combined commentaries of these three scholars is known as the Sanjiazhu ( "commentaries of the three experts") The primary modern edition of the Records is the tenvolume Zhonghua Book Company edition of 1959 (revised in 1982) which is based on an edition prepared by the Chinese historian Gu Jiegang in the early 1930s and includes the Sanjiazhu

Manuscripts
There are two known surviving fragments of preTang dynasty Records manuscripts both of which are held in the Ishiyamadera temple in Ōtsu Japan Portions of at least nine Tang dynasty manuscripts survive: three fragments discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the early 20th century and six manuscripts preserved in Japanese temples and museums such as the Kōzanji temple in Kyoto and the Tōyō Bunko museum in Tokyo Several woodblock printed editions of the Records survive the earliest of which date to the Song dynasty (9601279)

In all the Records is about 526500 Chinese characters long making it four times longer than Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War and longer than the Old Testament

Sima Qian conceived and composed his work in selfcontained units with a good deal of repetition between them His manuscript was written on bamboo slips with about 24 to 36 characters each and assembled into bundles of around 30 slips Even after the manuscript was allowed to circulate or be copied the work would have circulated as bundles of bamboo slips or small groups Endymion Wilkinson calculates that there were probably between 466 and 700 bundles whose total weight would have been  which would have been difficult to access and hard to transport Later copies on silk would have been much lighter but also expensive and rare Until the work was transferred to paper many centuries later circulation would have been difficult and piecemeal which accounts for many of the errors and variations in the text

Sima Qian organized the chapters of Records of the Grand Historian into five categories which each comprise a section of the book

"Basic Annals"
The "Basic Annals" (běnjì ) make up the first 12 chapters of the Records and are largely similar to records from the ancient Chinese court chronicle tradition such as the Spring and Autumn Annals The first five cover either periods such as the Three Sovereigns and Five EmperorsFive Emperors
"Tables"
Chapters 13 to 22 are the "Tables" (biǎo ) which comprise one genealogical table and nine other chronological tables They show reigns important events and royal lineages in table form which Sima Qian stated that he did because "the chronologies are difficult to follow when different genealogical lines exist at the same time" Each table except the last one begins with an introduction to the period it covers

"Treatises"
The "Treatises" (shū  sometimes called "Monographs") is the shortest of the five Records sections and contains eight chapters (23–30) on the historical evolution of ritual music pitch pipes the calendar astronomy sacrifices rivers and waterways and financial administration

"Hereditary Houses"
The "Hereditary Houses" (shìjiā ) is the second largest of the five Records sections and comprises chapters 31 to 60 Within this section the earlier chapters are very different in nature than the later chapters Many of the earlier chapters are chroniclelike accounts of the leading states of the Zhou dynasty such as the states of Qin (state)
"Ranked Biographies"
The "Ranked Biographies" (lièzhuàn  usually shortened to "Biographies") is the largest of the five Records sections covering chapters 61 to 130 and accounts for 42% of the entire work The 69 "Biographies" chapters mostly contain biographical profiles of about 130 outstanding ancient Chinese men ranging from the moral paragon Boyi and Shuqi
Style
File:Sima Qian (painted portrait)jpg
Unlike subsequent official historical texts that adopted Confucian doctrine proclaimed the divine rights of the emperors and degraded any failed claimant to the throne Sima Qians more liberal and objective prose has been renowned and followed by poets and novelists Most volumes of Liezhuan are vivid descriptions of events and persons Sima Qian sought out stories from those who might have closer knowledge of certain historical events using them as sources to balance the reliability and accuracy of historical records For instance the material on Jing Kes attempt at assassinating the Qin Shi Huang
It has been observed that the diplomatic Sima Qian has a way of accentuating the positive in his treatment of rulers in the Basic Annals but slipping negative information into other chapters and so his work must be read as a whole to obtain full information For example the information that Emperor Gaozu of Han
Source materials
Simas family were hereditary historians to the Han emperor Sima Qians father Sima Tan served as Grand Historian and Sima Qian succeeded to his position Thus he had access to the early Han dynasty archives edicts and records Sima Qian was a methodical skeptical historian who had access to ancient books written on bamboo and wooden slips from before the time of the Han dynasty Many of the sources he used did not survive He not only used archives and imperial records but also interviewed people and traveled around China to verify information In his first chapter "Annals of the Five Emperors" he writes

poem quote

I myself have travelled west as far as Kongtong Mountains
The Grand Historian used The Annals of the Five Emperors () and the Classic of History as source materials to make genealogies from the time of the Yellow Emperor until that of the Gonghe (regency)
In the 19th chapter he writes "I have occasion to read over the records of enfeoffment and come to the case of Wu Qian the marquis of Bian" (The father of Marquis Bian Wu Rui was named king (wang) of Changsha KingdomFile:Records of the Grand Historianjpg
Sima Qian wrote of the problems with incomplete fragmentary and contradictory sources For example he mentioned in the preface to chapter 15 that the chronicle records of the feudal states kept in the Zhou dynastys archive were burnt by Qin Shi Huang because they contained criticisms and ridicule of the Qin state and that the Qin annals were brief and incomplete In the 13th chapter he mentioned that the chronologies and genealogies of different ancient texts "disagree and contradict each other throughout" In his 18th chapter Sima Qian writes "I have set down only what is certain and in doubtful cases left a blank"

Reliability and accuracy
Scholars have questioned the historicity of legendary kings of the ancient periods given by Sima Qian Sima Qian began the Shiji with an account of the five rulers of supreme virtue the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors
However according to Joseph Needham who wrote in 1954 on Sima Qians accounts of the kings of the Shang dynasty (c 1600 – c 1050 BC): 

While the king names in Sima Qians history of the Shang dynasty are supported by inscriptions on the oracle bones there is as yet no archaeological corroboration of Sima Qians history of the Xia dynasty

There are also discrepancies of fact such as dates between various portions of the work This may be a result of Sima Qians use of different source texts

Transmission and supplementation by other writers
After ca 91 BC the moreorless completed manuscript was hidden in the residence of the authors daughter Sima Ying () to avoid destruction under Emperor Wu of Han
The changes in the manuscript of the Shiji during this hiatus have always been disputed among scholars That the text was more or less complete by ca 91 BC is established in the Letter to Renan () composed in the Zhenghe () era of Emperor Wus reign In this letter Sima Qian describes his work as "spanning from the time of the Yellow Emperor to the present age and consisting of ten tables twelve basic annals eight treatises thirty chapters on hereditary houses and seventy biographies together totaling 130 chapters" These numbers are likewise given in the postface to Shiji

After his death (presumably only a few years later) few people had the opportunity to see the whole work However various additions were still made to it The historian Liu Zhiji reported the names of a total of fifteen scholars supposed to have added material to the Shiji during the period after the death of Sima Qian Only the additions by Chu Shaosun ( c 105 – c 30 BC) are clearly indicated by adding "Mr Chu said" (Chu xiansheng yue ) Already in the first century AD Ban Biao and Ban Gu claimed that ten chapters in Records of the Grand Historian were lacking <!must have been completed later > A large number of chapters dealing with the first century of the Han dynasty (ie the 2nd century BC) correspond exactly to the relevant chapters from the Book of Han (Hanshu) It is unclear whether those chapters initially came from the Shiji or from the Hanshu Researchers Yves Hervouet (1921–1999) and A F P Hulsewé argued that the originals of those chapters of the Shiji were lost and they were later reconstructed using the corresponding chapters from the Hanshu

Editions
The earliest extant copy of Records of the Grand Historian handwritten was made during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420–589 AD) The earliest printed edition called Shiji jijie ( literally Records of the Grand Historian Collected Annotations) was published during the Northern Song dynasty Huang Shanfus edition printed under the Southern Song dynasty is the earliest collection of the Sanjiazhu commentaries on Records of the Grand Historian ( literally: The Combined Annotations of the Three Experts)

In modern times the Zhonghua Book Company in Beijing has published the book in both simplified Chinese for mass consumption and traditional Chinese for scholarly study The 1959 (2nd ed 1982) Sanjiazhu edition in traditional Chinese (based upon the Jinling Publishing House edition see below) contains commentaries interspersed among the main text and is considered to be an authoritative modern edition
