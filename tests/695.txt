Moravecs paradox is the observation in artificial intelligence and robotics that contrary to traditional assumptions reasoning requires very little computation but Sensory processingSensorimotor system
Similarly Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness "In general were least aware of what our minds do best" he wrote and added "were more aware of simple processes that dont work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly" Steven Pinker wrote in 1994 that "the main lesson of thirtyfive years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard"

By the 2020s in accordance to Moores law computers were hundreds of millions of times faster than in the 1970s and the additional computer power was finally sufficient to begin to handle machine perception
The biological basis of human skills
One possible explanation of the paradox offered by Moravec is based on evolution All human skills are implemented biologically using machinery designed by the process of natural selection In the course of their evolution natural selection has tended to preserve design improvements and optimizations The older a skill is the more time natural selection has had to improve the design Abstract thought developed only very recently and consequently we should not expect its implementation to be particularly efficient

As Moravec writes:


A compact way to express this argument would be:
 We should expect the difficulty of reverseengineering any human skill to be roughly proportional to the amount of time that skill has been evolving in animals
 The oldest human skills are largely unconscious and so appear to us to be effortless
 Therefore we should expect skills that appear effortless to be difficult to reverseengineer but skills that require effort may not necessarily be difficult to engineer at all

Some examples of skills that have been evolving for millions of years: recognizing a face moving around in space judging peoples motivations catching a ball recognizing a voice setting appropriate goals paying attention to things that are interesting; anything to do with perception attention visualization motor skills social skills and so on

Some examples of skills that have appeared more recently: mathematics engineering games logic and scientific reasoning These are hard for us because they are not what our bodies and brains were primarily evolved to do These are skills and techniques that were acquired recently in historical time and have had at most a few thousand years to be refined mostly by cultural evolution

Historical influence on artificial intelligence
In the early days of artificial intelligence research leading researchers often predicted that they would be able to create thinking machines in just a few decades (see history of artificial intelligenceOptimism"Herbert Simon a pioneer of artificial intelligence (AI) famously predicted in 1965 that “machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do” &mdash; to achieve humanlevel general AI" assumed that having (almost) solved the "hard" problems the "easy" problems of computer vision
Rodney Brooks explains that according to early AI research intelligence was "best characterized as the things that highly educated male scientists found challenging" such as chess symbolic integration proving math
In the 1980s this would lead Brooks to pursue a new direction in artificial intelligence and robotics research He decided to build intelligent machines that had "No cognition Just sensing and action That is all I would build and completely leave out what traditionally was thought of as the intelligence of artificial intelligence" He called this new direction "Nouvelle AI"

Similarly successful 21st century AI applications dont simulate stepbystep "intelligent" problem solving they simulate the fast "intuitive" judgements people use to instantly and automatically recognize patterns and anomalies

Reception
Linguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker considers this the main lesson uncovered by AI researchers In his 1994 book The Language Instinct he wrote:
