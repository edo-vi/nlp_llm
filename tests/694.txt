"Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics" is the title of a letter to the editor written by Jane Porter and Hershel Jick and published in the January 10 1980 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine The letter analyzed data on patients who had been treated with opioids in a hospital setting and concluded that addiction was uncommon among such patients It has since been frequently misrepresented to claim that opioids are not addictive when prescribed for use at home which has been blamed for contributing to the opioid epidemic in the United States

Content
The letter reported on an examination of medical files of patients who had been hospitalized and treated with small doses of opioids The authors concluded that of the 11882 patients who received at least one narcotic drug only four of them had developed a "reasonably well documented" addiction among patients who had no history of addiction Its text read in its entirety: 

Influence
The article has been cited extensively as evidence that addiction was very rare among patients who were prescribed narcotics (more specifically opioids) It became so well known that it is sometimes referred to simply as Porter and Jick

Methodological limitations
Methodological limitations from which the letter suffered included that the patients it reported on were all given opioids in small doses in a hospital

Misrepresentation
In 2017 the letter attracted renewed interest because the New England Journal of Medicine published a bibliographic analysis of the letter showing that it had been cited 608 times since it was published In comparison the other letters to the editor in the same issue of the Journal as Porter and Jicks letter had been cited a median of 11 times Of these 608 citations the analysis also showed that 722% of them cited it in support of the claim that patients treated with opioids rarely developed addiction and 808% did not mention that the letter only included data on prescriptions given to hospitalized patients It was also misrepresented in the popular media; a 1990 Scientific American article described it as an "extensive study" and a 2001 Time (magazine)
Role in the opioid epidemic
Because the letter has been frequently misrepresented to argue that opioids were rarely addictive these misrepresentations have been blamed for contributing to the opioid epidemic For example a coauthor of the 2017 bibliographic analysis David Juurlink has stated that he thinks the letters appearance in a prestigious journal helped convince doctors that opioids were safe saying "I think its fair to say that this letter went quite a long way" Jick who wrote the letter has since said that "The letter wasnt of value to health and medicine in and of itself So if I could take it backâ€”if I knew then what I know now I would never have published it It wasnt worth it"
