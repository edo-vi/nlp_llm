Neontology is a part of biology that in contrast to paleontology deals with living (or more generally Holocene* The moose (Alces alces) is an extant species and the Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus) is an extinct species. 
* In the group of molluscs known as the cephalopods  there were approximately 600 extant species and 7500 extinct species.

A taxon can be classified as extinct if it is broadly agreed or certified that no members of the group are still alive. Conversely an extinct taxon can be reclassified as extant if there are new discoveries of living species ("Lazarus species") or if previously known extant species are reclassified as members of the taxon.

Neontological evolutionary biology has a temporal perspective between 100 and 1000 years. Neontologys fundamental basis relies on models of natural selection as well as speciation. Neontologys methods when compared to evolutionary paleontology have a greater emphasis on experiments. There are more frequent discontinuities present in paleontology than in neontology because paleontology involves extinct taxa. Neontology has organisms actually present and available to sample and perform research on. Neontologys research method uses cladistics to examine morphology (biology)

Extant taxa versus extinct taxa
Neontology studies extant (living) taxa and recently extinct taxa but declaring a taxon to be definitively extinct is difficult. Taxa that have previously been declared extinct may reappear over time. Species that were once considered extinct and then reappear unscathed are characterized by the term "the Lazarus effect" or are also called a Lazarus species. For example a study determined that 36% of supposed mammalian extinction had been proven while the other 64% had insufficient evidence to be declared extinct or had been rediscovered. Currently the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers a taxon to be recently extinct if the extinction occurred after 1500 Common Era
Neontology importance
Neontologys fundamental theories rely on biological models of natural selection and speciation that connect genes the unit of heredity with the mechanism of evolution by natural selection. For example researchers utilized neontological and paleontological datasets to study nonhuman primate dentition compared with human dentition. In order to understand the underlying genetic mechanisms that influence this variation between nonhuman primates and humans neontological methods are applied to the research method. By incorporating neontology with different biological research methods it can become clear how genetic mechanisms underlie major events in processes such as primate evolution.
