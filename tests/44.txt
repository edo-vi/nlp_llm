The Cochrane Collaboration is a British international charitable organisation formed to synthesise medical research findings to facilitate evidencebased medicine
The group conducts systematic reviews of healthcare interventions and diagnostic tests and publishes them in the Cochrane Library A few reviews in occupational health for example incorporate results from nonrandomised observational study


History

Cochrane previously known as the Cochrane Collaboration was founded in 1993 under the leadership of Iain Chalmers It was developed in response to Archie Cochranes call for uptodate systematic reviews of all relevant randomised controlled trials in the field of healthcare

In 1998 the Cochrane Economics Methods Group (CEMG) was established to facilitate the basing of decisions on health economics evidencebased medicine and systematic reviews

Cochranes suggestion that methods used to prepare and maintain reviews of controlled trials in pregnancy and childbirth be applied more widely was taken up by the Research and Development Programme initiated to support the National Health Service Through the NHS research and development programme led by Michael Peckham funds were provided to establish a "Cochrane Centre" to collaborate with others in the UK and elsewhere to facilitate systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials across all areas of healthcare

In 2004 the Campbell Collaboration joined with the CEMG to form the Campbell & Cochrane Economics Methods Group (CCEMG)

In 2013 the organization published an editorial describing its efforts to train people in developing nations to perform Cochrane reviews A 2017 editorial briefly discussed the history of Cochrane methodological approaches such as including studies that use methodologies in lieu of randomized controlled trial
During its 2018 annual meeting the Cochrane board expelled Peter C Gøtzsche board member and director of Cochranes Nordic center from the organization telling Nature (journal)
Reception
A 2004 editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal noted that Cochrane reviews appear to be more up to date and of better quality than other reviews describing them as "the best single resource for methodologic research and for developing the science of metaepidemiology" and crediting them with leading to methodological improvements in the medical literature

Studies comparing the quality of Cochrane metaanalyses in the fields of infertility physiotherapy and orthodontics to those published by other sources have concluded that Cochrane reviews incorporate superior methodological rigor A broader analysis across multiple therapeutic areas reached similar conclusions but was performed by Cochrane authors
Compared to nonCochrane reviews those from Cochrane are less likely to reach a positive conclusion about the utility of medical interventions

Key criticisms that have been directed at Cochranes studies include a failure to include a sufficiently large number of unpublished studies failure to prespecify or failure to abide by prespecified rules for endpoint or trial inclusion insufficiently frequent updating of reviews an excessively high percentage of inconclusive reviews and a high incidence of ghostwriting and honorary authorship In some cases Cochranes internal structure may make it difficult to publish studies that run against the preconceived opinions of internal subject matter experts

Partnerships

World Health Organization
Cochrane maintains an official relationship with the World Health Organization that affords Cochrane the right to appoint nonvoting representatives to WHO meetings including sessions of the World Health Assembly and make statements on WHO resolutions

Wikipedia

In 2014 the CochraneWikipedia partnership was formalised This supports the inclusion of relevant evidence within all Wikipedia medical articles as well as processes to help ensure that medical information included in Wikipedia is of the highest quality and accuracy Wikipedia and Cochrane collaborate to increase the incorporation of Cochrane research into Wikipedia articles and provide Wikipedia editors with resources for interpreting medical data Cochrane and John Wiley and Sons publisher of Cochrane reviews make one hundred free Cochrane accounts available to Wikipedia medical editors—the financial value of which has been estimated by Cochrane at between thirty thousand and eighty thousand US dollars per annum—and pay a nominal stipend and travel expenses to support a Wikipedian in Residence at Cochrane

In 2014 the Cochrane blog hosted a rebuttal written by four Wikipedia medical editors of an article published in the American Osteopathic Association
 Funding partners 
Cochrane receives funding from governments Supranational organisation
Academic funders include McMaster University Amsterdam University Medical Centers Kazan Federal University and University of Copenhagen among others Funding from foundations includes the National Research Foundation (South Africa) and the Gerber Foundation

Public involvement
Cochrane involves the public via biocurationCommunity curation Joining a collaborative volunteer effort to help categorise and summarise healthcare evidence
 Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
 translation of reviews into other languages

A recent systematic review of how people were involved in systematic reviews aimed to document the evidencebase relating to stakeholder involvement in systematic reviews and to use this evidence to describe how stakeholders have been involved in systematic reviews Thirty per cent involved patients and/or carers

While there has been some criticism of how Cochrane prioritises systematic reviews a recent project involved people in helping identify research priorities to inform future Cochrane Reviews

The representation of women as editors in Cochrane was found to be better than that of other organizations
