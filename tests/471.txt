An anticor also known as anticoeur or avantcœur among farriers is a dangerous swelling or inflammation in a horses breast of the size and shape of an apple just opposite the heart The term literally means anti heart or before heart

The swelling may appear as a hard tumor slow to develop or as an inflammation A traditional remedy in the first case involves splitting the skin along the breadth of the tumor allowing the matter contained to escape and stopping the hemorrhage by using an amadou or a hot iron This kind of operation is best done by a veterinarian If the tumor is inflammatory one resorts to an oil of pompillion an ointment made of buds of black poplar lard and sheets of poppy belladonna etc If it has formed an abscess one first applies a soft poultice

In premodern medicine this was thought to be caused by a sanguine and bile
In humans this is called Ludwigs angina or squinancy
