Chlamydia caviae is a bacterium that can be recovered from the conjunctiva of Guinea pigs suffering from ocular inflammation and eye discharge  It is also possible to infect the genital tract of Guinea pigs with C caviae and elicit a disease that is very similar to human Chlamydia trachomatis infection  C caviae infects primarily the mucosal epithelium and is not invasive

C caviae is markedly specific for Guinea pigs as attempts to infect mice hamsters rabbits and gerbils have been unsuccessful except for one experimentally infected gerbil  The five known C caviae isolates are indistinguishable based on ompA gene sequence

Genome structure
C caviae has a relatively small genome that contains 117 Mbp with 998 protein coding genes  Additionally C caviae strain GPIC contains an extrachromosomal plasmid pCpGP1
