Blockhead is the name of a theoretical computer system invented as part of a thought experiment by philosopher Ned Block which appeared in a paper titled "Psychologism and Behaviorism" Block did not name the computer in the paper

Overview
In "Psychologism and Behaviorism" Block argues that the internal mechanism of a system is important in determining whether that system is intelligent and claims to show that a nonintelligent system could pass the Turing test

Block asks us to imagine a conversation lasting any given amount of time He states that given the nature of language there are a finite number of syntax
Block then asks the reader to imagine a computer which had been programmed with all the sentences in theory if not in practice Block argues that such a machine could continue a conversation with a person on any topic because the computer would be programmed with every sentence that it was possible to use so the computer would be able to pass the Turing test despite the fact that — according to Block — it was not intelligent

Block says that this does not show that there is only one correct internal structure for generating intelligence but simply that some internal structures do not generate intelligence

The argument is related to John Searles Chinese room

A recent objection to the Blockhead argument is Hanoch BenYami (2005) who agrees that Blocks machine lacks intelligence but compares its answers to a poetic dialogue in which one man is whispered romantic poetry to recite to his wouldbe lover as it answers only what it has been told to answer in advance by its programmers
