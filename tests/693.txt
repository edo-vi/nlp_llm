Cultural hitchhiking is a hypothesized Dual inheritance theory
Cultural hitchhiking has been proposed as a cause for reduced genetic diversity at certain loci in prehistoric  Homo sapiens dolphins killer whales and sperm whales.

Cultural hitchhiking is a significant hypothesis because it investigates the relationship between population genetics and culture. By understanding how social behavior can shape the genetic makeup of communities scientists are better able to explain why certain communities have genetic traits distinct from the larger population.

 In whales 
The process was initially proposed by Whitehead in a 1998 paper as an explanation for the low genetic diversity in Matrilineality
 In dolphins 
In 2014 a team of biologists from the University of South Wales attributed a remarkable geographic distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes among adjacent populations of bottlenose dolphins in a bay in Western Australia to cultural hitchhiking. The researchers found Whiteheadâ€™s hypothesis that selection for learned social traits affected diversity in neutral gene loci fit well with their observations. It was discovered that dolphins with two of three mitochondrial haplotypes were found predominantly in water deeper than 10 m while those with the third haplotypes were found predominantly in depths less than 10 m. This geographic distinction between these populations is also associated with different learned behaviors. Some of the dolphins predominantly found in deeper waters exhibit foraging strategies that implement tools such as a sponge placed on their beak. This "sponging" behavior is found to be spread through vertical social transmission along a matrilineal pattern (i.e. the mothers teach the behavior to their offspring). All dolphins exhibiting one of the deepwater haplotypes belong to a single matriline. The researchers ultimately concluded that these fine-scale genetic structures the distinct mitochondrial haplotypes have probably arisen based on socially transmitted behaviors or in other words through cultural hitchhiking. A study in the same area and species showed that shelling (fishing)
 In early humans 
Cultural hitchhiking has been proposed as an explanation for a widely inferred and abrupt Population bottleneck
