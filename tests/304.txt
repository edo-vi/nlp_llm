 Advantages 

In human vaccine development the main advantage is rapid propagation and high yield of viruses for vaccine production This method is most commonly used for growth of influenza virus both attenuated vaccine and inactivated vaccine forms It is recommended by the World Health Organization in managing influenza pandemics because it is highyield and cost effective 

In poultry In ovo vaccination improves hatchability and efficient protection against Avian influenza (AI) Newcastle disease (ND) and Coronaviruses (AvCoV) Seroconversion rates of chickens vaccinated as embryos ranged from 27% to 100% with ND vaccination and 85% to 100% for AI vaccination The birds are protected before delivery to a commercial operation such as a farm thus preventing the spread of Avian viruses

 Vaccination 

In ovo vaccination is carried out by machines These machines perform a number of actions to ensure good vaccination of the chick inside the egg Benefits of In ovo vaccination include avoidance of bird stress controlled hygienic conditions and earlier immunity with less interference from maternal antibodies
