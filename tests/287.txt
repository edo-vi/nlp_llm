In a functional bioactive terrarium the waste products will be broken down by these Detritivore
Enclosure
Any terrarium can be made bioactive by addition of the appropriate substrate plants and detritivores. Bioactive enclosures are often maintained as display terraria constructed of PVC wood glass and/or acrylic. Bioactive enclosures in laboratory "rack" style caging are uncommon.

Substrate
File:Starr-080117-1726-Epipremnum pinnatum-leaves-Walmart Kahului-Maui (24807373811).jpgBioactive enclosures require some form of substrate to grow plants and to provide habitat for the cleanup crew.  The choice of substrate is typically determined by the habitat of the primary species (e.g. jungle vs desert) and created by mixing a variety of components such as organic topsoil (free of pesticides and non-biological fertilizers) peat coco fiber sand long-fiber sphagnum moss cypress mulch and orchid bark in varying proportions.  

In wet habitats there is typically a drainage layer beneath the substrate to allow water to pool without saturating the substrate. The drainage layer may be constructed via coarse gravel stones expanded clay aggregate or may be wholly synthetic; the drainage layer is typically separated from the overlying substrate with a fine plastic mesh.  Additionally some bioactive terraria include leaf-litter which can serve as food and microhabitat for the cleanup crew.

Plants
The use of live plants in a bioactive terrarium provides cover for animals inhabiting the enclosure is aesthetically pleasing in a display enclosure and can help to absorb nitrogenous wastes that could otherwise build up in a system.
