The Western canon is the body of High culture
Literary canon
Classic book
File:Shakespearejpg
A classic is a book or any other work of art accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy In the secondcentury Ancient Rome
With regard to books what makes a book "classic" has concerned various authors from Mark Twain to Italo Calvino and questions such as "Why Read the Classics?" and "What Is a Classic?" have been considered by others including T S Eliot Charles Augustin SainteBeuve Michael Dirda and Ezra Pound

The terms "classic book" and Western canon are closely related concepts but are not necessarily synonymous A "canon" is a list of books considered to be "essential" and it can be published as a collection (such as Great Books of the Western World Modern Library Everymans Library or Penguin Classics) presented as a list with an academics imprimatur (such as Harold Blooms) or be the official reading list of a university In The Western Canon Bloom lists "the major Western writers" as Dante Alighieri Geoffrey Chaucer Miguel de Cervantes Michel de Montaigne William Shakespeare Johann Wolfgang von Goethe William Wordsworth Charles Dickens Leo Tolstoy James Joyce and Marcel Proust

The Bible a product of ancient Jewish culture from the Levant in Western Asia has been a major force in shaping Western culture and "has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought literature and art"

Great Books Program
Image:Great BooksjpgA university or college Great Books Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s by John Erskine (educator)
The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with primary texts called the Great Books The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a students education such as Platos Republic or Dantes Divine Comedy Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures and have small class sizes In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning

Over 100 institutions of higher learning mostly in the United States offer some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students

For much of the 20th century the Modern Library provided a larger convenient list of the Western canon ie those books  any person (or any Englishspeaking person) needed to know in order to claim an excellent general education The list numbered more than 300 items by the 1950s by authors from Aristotle to Albert Camus and has continued to grow When in the 1990s the concept of the Western canon was vehemently condemned just as earlier Modern Library lists had been criticized as "too American" Modern Library responded by preparing new lists of "100 Best Novels" and "100 Best Nonfiction" compiled by famous writers and later compiled lists nominated by book purchasers and readers

Debate<!Dead white male Dead white males Dead white man and Dead white men redirect here>

Some intellectuals have championed a "high conservative modernism" that insists that universal truths exist and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths Yale University Professor of Humanities and famous literary critic Harold Bloom has also argued strongly in favor of the canon in his 1994 book The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages  and in general the canon remains as a represented idea in many institutions His book was widely cited by some intellectuals for its argument that the classics contained universal truths and timeless values which were being ignored by cultural relativism
Classicist Bernard Knox made direct reference to this topic when he delivered his 1992 Jefferson Lecture (the US federal governments highest honor for achievement in the humanities)  Knox used the intentionally "provocative" title "The Oldest Dead White European Males" as the title of his lecture and his subsequent book of the same name in both of which Knox defended the continuing relevance of Classics
Defenders maintain that those who undermine the canon do so out of primarily political interests and that such criticisms are misguided and/or disingenuous As John Searle Professor of Philosophy at the University of California Berkeley has written:


One of the main objections to a canon of literature is the question of authority; who should have the power to determine what works are worth reading?

Charles Altieri of the University of California Berkeley states that canons are "an institutional form for exposing people to a range of idealized attitudes" It is according to this notion that work may be removed from the canon over time to reflect the contextual relevance and thoughts of society American historian Todd M Compton argues that canons are always communal in nature; that there are limited canons for say a literature survey class or an English department reading list but there is no such thing as one absolute canon of literature Instead there are many conflicting canons He regards Blooms "Western Canon" as a personal canon only

The process of defining the boundaries of the canon is endless The philosopher John Searle has said "In my experience there never was in fact a fixed canon; there was rather a certain set of tentative judgments about what had importance and quality Such judgments are always subject to revision and in fact they were constantly being revised" One of the notable attempts at compiling an authoritative canon for literature in the Englishspeaking world was the Great Books of the Western World program This program developed in the middle third of the 20th century grew out of the curriculum at the University of Chicago University president Robert Maynard Hutchins and his collaborator Mortimer Adler developed a program that offered reading lists books and organizational strategies for reading clubs to the general public An earlier attempt had been made in 1909 by Harvard University president Charles W Eliot with the Harvard Classics a 51volume anthology of classic works from world literature Eliots view was the same as that of Scottish philosopher and historian Thomas Carlyle: "The true University of these days is a Collection of Books" ("The Hero as Man of Letters" 1840)

In the Englishspeaking world

 British renaissance poetry 


The canon of Renaissance English poetry of the 16th and early 17th century has always been in some form of flux and towards the end of the 20th century the established canon was criticised especially by those who wished to expand it to include for example more women writers However the central figures of the British renaissance canon remain Edmund Spenser Sir Philip Sidney Christopher Marlowe William Shakespeare Ben Jonson and John Donne Edmund Spenser
In the twentieth century T S Eliot and Yvor Winters were two literary critics who were especially concerned with revising the canon of renaissance English literature Eliot for example championed poet Sir John Davies in an article in The Times Literary Supplement in 1926 During the course of the 1920s Eliot did much to establish the importance of the metaphysical school both through his critical writing and by applying their method in his own work However by 1961 A Alvarez was commenting that "it may perhaps be a little late in the day to be writing about the Metaphysicals The great vogue for Donne passed with the passing of the AngloAmerican experimental movement in modern poetry" Two decades later a hostile view was expressed that emphasis on their importance had been an attempt by Eliot and his followers to impose a high Anglican and royalist literary history on 17thcentury English poetry

The American critic Yvor Winters suggested in 1939 an alternative canon of Elizabethan poetry which would exclude the famous representatives of the Petrarchan
Towards the end of the 20th century the established canon was increasingly disputed

Expansion of the literary canon in the 20th century
In the twentieth century there was a general reassessment of the literary canon including Womens writing in English
The Western literary canon has also expanded to include the literature of Asia Africa the Middle East and South America Writers from Africa Turkey China Egypt Peru and Colombia Japan etc have received Nobel prizes since the late 1960s Writers from Asia and Africa have also been nominated for and also won the List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize for Fiction
 Feminism and the literary canon 

File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorialjpg
Susan Hardy Aitken argues that the Western canon has maintained itself by excluding and marginalising women whilst idealising the works of European men Where womens work is introduced it can be considered inappropriately rather than recognising the importance of their work; a works greatness is judged against socially situated factors which exclude women whilst being portrayed as an intellectual approach

The feminist movement produced both feminist fiction and nonfiction and created new interest in womens writing It also prompted a general reevaluation of womens Womens history
However in Britain and America at least women achieved major literary success from the late eighteenth century and many major nineteenthcentury British novelists were women including Jane Austen the BrontÃ«s
Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women Virago Press began to publish its large list of 19th and early 20thcentury novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation

African and AfroAmerican authors
In the twentieth century the Western literary canon started to include African writers not only from AfricanAmerican literature
Some early AfroAmerican writers were inspired to defy ubiquitous Racism
AfricanAmerican writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as "something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity" In producing their own literature African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the European intellectual filter This view of AfricanAmerican literature as a tool in the struggle for AfricanAmerican political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades most famously by W E B Du Bois

Canon of philosophers


File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377jpg
Many philosophers today agree that Greek philosophy has influenced much of Western culture since its inception Alfred North Whitehead once noted: "The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato" Clear unbroken lines of influence lead from Ancient Greece
Plato was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Platonic Academy
Aristotle was an Ancient Greece
The vast body of Christian philosophy is typically represented on reading lists mainly by Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas The academic canon of early modern philosophy generally includes Descartes Spinoza Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
Renaissance philosophy
Major philosophers of the Renaissance include NiccolÃ² Machiavelli Michel de Montaigne Pico della Mirandola Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno

Seventeenthcentury philosophers

File:Leviathan by Thomas HobbesjpgThe seventeenth century was important for philosophy and the major figures were Francis Bacon Thomas Hobbes RenÃ© Descartes Blaise Pascal Baruch Spinoza John Locke and  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

Eighteenthcentury philosophers
Major philosophers of the eighteenth century include George Berkeley Montesquieu Voltaire David Hume JeanJacques Rousseau Denis Diderot Immanuel Kant Edmund Burke and Jeremy Bentham

Nineteenthcentury philosophers
Important nineteenth century philosophers include Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770â1831) Arthur Schopenhauer Auguste Comte SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard Karl Marx Friedrich Engels and Friedrich Nietzsche

Twentiethcentury philosophers
Major twentieth century figures include Henri Bergson Edmund Husserl Bertrand Russell Martin Heidegger  Ludwig Wittgenstein and JeanPaul Sartre Simone de Beauvoir and Simone Weil Michel Foucault Pierre Bourdieu Jacques Derrida and JÃ¼rgen Habermas A porous distinction between Analytic philosophy
Music
File:Johann Sebastian BachjpgClassical music forms the core of canon music and remains mostly unchanged to our days It integrates a huge body of works starting from the 17th century and are reproduced on an ensemble of all acoustic musical instruments that were common in that centurys Europe

The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Ludwig van Beethoven as a golden age In addition to Bach and Beethoven the other major figures from this period were George Frideric Handel Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary is from about 1836

In classical music during the nineteenth century a "canon" developed which focused on what was felt to be the most important works written since 1600 with a great concentration on the later part of this period termed the Classical period (music)
In the 2000s the standard concert repertoire of professional orchestras chamber music groups and choirs tends to focus on works by a relatively small number of mainly 18th and 19thcentury male composers Many of the works deemed to be part of the musical canon are from genres regarded as the most serious such as the symphony concerto string quartet and opera Folk music was already giving art music melodies and from the late 19th century in an atmosphere of increasing nationalism folk music began to influence composers in formal and other ways before being admitted to some sort of status in the canon itself

Since the early twentieth century nonWestern music has begun to influence Western composers In particular direct homages to Javanese gamelan music are found in works for western instruments by Claude Debussy BÃ©la BartÃ³k Francis Poulenc Olivier Messiaen Pierre Boulez Benjamin Britten John Cage Steve Reich and Philip Glass Debussy was immensely interested in nonWestern music and its approaches to composition Specifically he was drawn to the Javanese gamelan  which he first heard at the Exposition Universelle (1889)File:The Concert A22894jpg
In the latter half of the 20th century the canon expanded to cover the socalled Early music of the preclassical period and Baroque music by composers other than Bach and George Frideric Handel including Antonio Vivaldi Claudio Monteverdi Domenico Scarlatti Alessandro Scarlatti Henry Purcell Georg Philipp Telemann JeanBaptiste Lully JeanPhilippe Rameau MarcAntoine Charpentier Arcangelo Corelli FranÃ§ois Couperin Heinrich SchÃ¼tz and Dieterich Buxtehude Earlier composers such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina Orlande de Lassus and William Byrd have also received more attention in the last hundred years

The absence of women composers from the classical canon was brought to the forefront of musicological literature in the late twentieth and early twentyfirst centuries Even though many women composers have written music in the common practice period and beyond their works remain extremely underrepresented in concert programs music history curriculums and music anthologies In particular musicologist Marcia J Citron has examined "the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received canon of performed musical works" Since around 1980 the music of Hildegard von Bingen (1098â1179) a German Benedictine abbess and Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho (born 1952) has begun to enter the canon Saariahos opera Lamour de loin has been staged in some of the worlds major opera houses including The English National Opera (2009) and in 2016 the Metropolitan Opera in New York

The classical ensemble canon very rarely integrates musical instruments that are not acoustic and of western origins it stayed apart from the wide use of electric electronic and digital instruments that are common in todays popular music

Visual arts

File:Capitoline Venus  Palazzo Nuovo  Musei Capitolini  Rome 2016jpg
The backbone of traditional Western art history are artworks commissioned by wealthy patrons for private or public enjoyment Much of this was religious art mostly Roman Catholic art The classical art of Greece and Rome has since the Renaissance been the fount of the Western tradition

Giorgio Vasari (1511â1574) is the originator of the artistic canon and the originator of many of the concepts it embodies  His Lives of the Most Excellent Painters Sculptors and Architects covers only artists working in Italy with a strong proFlorentine prejudice and has cast a long shadow over succeeding centuries  Northern European art has arguably never quite caught up to Italy in terms of prestige and Vasaris placing of Giotto as the founding father of "modern" painting has largely been retained  In painting the rather vague term of Old master covers painters up to about the time of Goya

This "canon" remains prominent as indicated by the selection present in art history textbooks as well as the prices obtained in the art trade But there have been considerable swings in what is valued In the 19th century the Baroque fell into great disfavour but it was revived from around the 1920s by which time the Academic art
In the 19th century the beginnings of academic art history led by German universities led to much better understanding and appreciation of medieval art and a more nuanced understanding of classical art including the realization that many if not most treasured masterpieces of sculpture were late Roman copies rather than Greek originals The European tradition of art was expanded to include Byzantine art and the new discoveries of archaeology notably Etruscan art Celtic art and Upper Paleolithic art

Since the 20th century there has been an effort to redefine the discipline to be more inclusive of art made by women; vernacular creativity especially in printed media; and an expansion to include works in the Western tradition produced outside Europe  At the same time there has been a much greater appreciation of nonWestern traditions including their place with Western art in wider global or Eurasian traditions The decorative arts have traditionally had a much lower critical status than fine art although often highly valued by collectors and still tend to be given little prominence in undergraduate studies or popular coverage on television and in print

Women and art

Historical exclusion of women
Women were discriminated against in terms of obtaining the training necessary to be an artist in the mainstream Western traditions In addition since the Renaissance the Nude (art)
In the 1970s feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history art museums and galleries and questioned which genres of art were deemed museumworthy This position is articulated by artist Judy Chicago:
"It is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions women experience primarily absence except in images that do not necessarily reflect womens own sense of themselves"

Spain
For the Spanish culture specially for the Spanish literature during the 19th and the first third of the 20th century similar lists were created trying to define the literary canon This canon was established mainly through teaching programs and literary critics like Pedro Estala Antonio Gil y ZÃ¡rate Marcelino MenÃ©ndez Pelayo RamÃ³n MenÃ©ndez Pidal or Juan Bautista Bergua In the last decades other important critics have been contributing to the topic among them Fernando LÃ¡zaro Carreter JosÃ© Manuel Blecua Perdices Francisco Rico and JosÃ© Carlos Mainer

Other Spanish languages have also their own literary canons A good introduction to the Catalan literary canon is La invenciÃ³ de la tradiciÃ³ literÃ ria by Manel OllÃ© from the Open University of Catalonia

 Evolution and criticism 
More recent discussions have been centered on expanding the canon of books to include more women and racial minorities while the canons of music and the visual arts have greatly expanded to cover the Middle Ages and subsequent centuries once largely overlooked But some examples of newer media such as Film
Expansion and changes to the canon have been criticized as promoting political and social activism at the expense of aesthetic values Broadly such criticism associates such changes with Marxist critical theory including AfricanAmerican studies Marxist literary criticism New Historicism
A different criticism comes for narrow interpretation of the concept of the West This criticism argues that the Western canon is dominated by British and American culture with a small dose of ancient western classics and a few nonEnglish works primarily from other Western European countries (like Germany or France) and almost no works from other regions such as Eastern Europe
