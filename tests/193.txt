The Vaccine Investigation and OnLine Information Network (VIOLIN) is the largest webbased vaccine database and analysis system VIOLIN currently contains over 3000 vaccines or vaccine candidates for over 190 pathogens The vaccine information in the database is collected by manual curation from over 1600 peerreviewed papers Different from most existing vaccine databases VIOLIN focuses on vaccine research data Different types of information is curated including vaccine name license status antigens used vaccine adjuvants vaccine vectors vaccination procedure host immune response challenge procedure vaccine efficacy adverse events etc All vaccine information in the VIOLIN vaccine database is supported by quoted references The data generated by a curator is published only after a careful review and approval by a vaccine domain expert

In addition VIOLIN includes many vaccine analysis programs For example VIOLIN includes Vaxign (http://wwwviolinetorg/vaxign) the first webbased vaccine design program based on the strategy of reverse vaccinology Vaxign has been tested in different pathogen models including uropathogenic E coli and Brucella spp

VIOLIN also maintains the official web page for the development of communitybased Vaccine Ontology (VO) (http://wwwviolinetorg/vaccineontology) VO is a formal biomedical ontology (computer science)
