IDEAL (Idea Development Exploration Assessment Longterm study) is a framework for describing the stages of innovation in surgery and other interventional procedures The purpose of IDEAL is to improve the quality of research in surgery by emphasizing appropriate methods transparency of data and rigorous reporting of outcomes

To achieve this the IDEAL framework provides a set of recommendations for improving the evidence base from research at each stage of innovation as outlined in the seminal paper published in The Lancet in 2009 The recommendations emphasize evaluating new procedures prospectively entering patients and studies into registries and databases to capture all incidences of a procedure and reporting outcomes by established protocols It is the first and only such framework for evidencebased practice that was established specifically for surgery and interventional procedures

 Background 
The IDEAL framework was the result of an expert Consensus decisionmaking
 Framework and recommendations 
The five stages of IDEAL and the recommendations for each stage are as follows:

 Stage 1: Idea 
 All new procedures should be reported automatically
 An online registry should be established for reporting of procedures
 Reports should include adverse events

 Stage 2a: Development 
 Protocols for prospective development studies should be established 
 Protocols should include details about patient selection operative methods and predefined outcomes
 A registry for these protocols should be established
 The publication of retrospective case series should be avoided
 If retrospective case series are to be published they should include all consecutive patients and adhere to a reporting template such as STROBE

 Stage 2b: Exploration 
 A prospective research database should be established
 Validated methods for evaluating learning curves such as CUSUM  should be used
 Reporting should be more diseasebased than procedurebased
 Outcome measures should be predefined and include technical clinical and patientreported outcomes

 Stage 3: Assessment 
 Study design should be a randomized controlled trial or acceptable alternatives

 Stage 4: Longterm study 
 Reporting should include only key outcomes and relevant information
 When comparing outcomes among different surgeons or interventionalists and institutions results should be adjusted for the comorbidities of the patient and the learning curve of the surgeon or interventionalist

 Proposals 
In the original publication in The Lancet the authors outline a number of proposals for key stakeholders in the generation of surgical evidence These include journal editors funders of services and research regulators and professional societies

 IDEAL collaboration 
The original IDEAL collaboration consists of attendees to the Balliol meetings Subsequent members include other stakeholders in evidencebased surgery and interventional procedures The IDEAL collaboration is led by Oxford surgeonresearcher Peter McCulloch

 Role in device regulation 
While the initial Balliol meetings were intended to address innovations in surgery and interventional procedures it soon became clear that there were also deficits in the evaluation of medical devices and implants used in such procedures In December 2011 the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug Administration held a public workshop on using the IDEAL framework to help develop highquality evidence for devices and implants In September 2012 the FDA published its strategy for improved postmarket surveillance based in part on the discussions from the IDEAL meeting including the promotion of registries for devices better assessment of evidence already published and improved reporting of adverse events
IDEAL collaborators have written several editorials and commentaries in journals such as the British Medical Journal and The Lancet concerning the regulation of devices
