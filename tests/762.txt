Concussions and playrelated head blows in American football have been shown to be the cause of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) which has led to player deaths and other debilitating symptoms after retirement including memory loss depression (mood)
The List of NFL players with chronic traumatic encephalopathyAccording to Boston University CTE is a brain degenerative disease found in athletes military veterans and others with history of repetitive brain trauma Although CTE is highly controversial and misunderstood it is believed that a protein called Tau forms clumps that slowly spread throughout the brain killing brain cells

There is also theoretical research that suggests early CTE might result from damaged blood vessels within the brain That could trigger brain inflammation and eventually the development of proteins such as Tau believed to play a key role in CTE This hypothesis was tested on adult mice; the researchers state that their brains possess similar attributes to that of human brains Using a special device the mice were given precise impacts that would lead to mild brain traumas similar to what an athlete would suffer in contact sports The mice whose brains were scanned using a specialized MRI immediately showed changes to the electrical functions of their brains

According to 2017 study on brains of deceased gridiron football players 99% of tested brains of National Football League
Other common injuries include injuries of legs arms neck and lower back

 NFL concussions 

Efforts are being made within the NFL to address concussions and promote player safety The league has made progress in recent years in reducing concussive injuries While there has been criticism it is evident that the NFL is committed to addressing these issues and making improvements wherever possible by actively working to reduce the risk of head injuries and make the game safer for players<ref>cite web

 History 
File:WCMorris SpokesmanReview cartoons 099 (1)jpgA concussion is a frequent injury among football players Concussions occur when the head is subject to a large impact force resulting in a minor brain injury  There has been a growing concern about concussions since the early 1900s  In 1906 a Harvard studentathlete died from a head injury and the team doctors released a report titled "The Physical Aspect of American Football" in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal describing the type severity and number of injuries the team sustained in the 1905 season

The NFL first began to review the subject formally in 1994 then NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue approved the creation of the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee with the stated goal of studying the effects of concussions and subconcussive injury in NFL players Tagliabue appointed rheumatologist Elliot Pellman to chair the committee Pellmans appointment was met with harsh criticism because he is not a neurologist or neuropsychologist and often admitted ignorance about head injuries

The same year the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in retired football players which furthered public knowledge about the risk of longterm neurocognitive disease related to repeated head impacts Despite the NIOSH study Pellman and the MTBI Committee drew their own conclusions that continued to contradict these findings and those of other organizations Biomechanical engineers and neurosurgeons informed the Committee that the helmet safety standard at that time was insufficient to minimize the risk of concussions

The MTBI Committee began studying the nature of Tackle (American football)
 Research 
Other organizations continued to publish study results that linked repeated concussions and longterm health problems contrary to reports by the MTBI Committee A 2003 report by the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the University of North Carolina for example found a connection between numerous concussions and depression among former professional football players Further the centers followup study in 2005 associated both brain impairment and Alzheimers disease with retired NFL players who had histories of concussions

A 2004 doctoral dissertation by Don Brady examined NFL Players knowledge of concussions studying both active and retired National Football League Players knowledge of concussions Bradys findings concluded: that many NFL players lacked accurate and essential knowledge pertaining to various aspects of a concussion; that the preponderance of credible experimental and clinical evidence pertaining to the adverse effects of concussion indicates that the brain is injured as a result of a concussion; that the altered cell functioning and cell death along with subtle to more visible neurological neurocognitive psychological and other medical problems reflect a diverse range of lifelong negative consequences of a concussion / brain injury; and that sports team healthcare personnel need to focus primarily on the athletes health and wellbeing and not minimize an injury or primarily concentrate on the players capacity to perform on the field This expanded focus of health care is necessary in order to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest emerging in the concussion research concussion management and related return to play decisionmaking process

During November 2014 Brady filed objections to the proposed NFL concussion settlement offer Brady sent a cover letter and detailed objections on behalf of NFL retired players to the presiding US district court judge Anita Brody

In addition to the studies that continued to contradict the work of the MTBI Committee renowned experts and sports journalists wrote critical reviews of the committees studies Robert Cantu of the American College of Sports Medicine noted bias in the committees extremely small sample size and held that no conclusions should be drawn from the NFLs studies In an ESPN Magazine article titled "Doctor Yes" Peter Keating criticized Pellman and the MTBI Committees work and argued that the " Committee has drawn a number of important conclusions about head trauma and how to treat it that contradict the research and experiences of many other doctors who treat sports concussions not to mention the players who have suffered them"

More studies continued to associate repetitive head injuries with neurological problems later in life Kevin Guskiewicz Director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science at the University of North Carolina analyzed data from a 2007 study of nearly 2500 former NFL players He found about 11 percent of the study participants suffered from clinical depression with a threefold increased risk in former players who had a history of three or four concussions The following year the NFL commissioned the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research to conduct a study involving more than 1000 former NFL players The results reported that Alzheimers disease or similar diseases appear to have been diagnosed in former NFL players vastly more often than in the general population at a rate of 19 times the normal rate for men ages 30 through 49 The NFL responded to these results by claiming the study was incomplete

On September 30 2014 researchers with Boston University announced that in autopsies of 79 brains of former NFL players 76 had tested positive for CTE As of January 2017 that number had grown to 90 out of 94 A study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in July 2017 showed that 110 of 111 former NFL players whose brains were examined were found to have suffered from CTE 

 Effects of concussions 

Concussions are such a big issue in the NFL today Many findings suggest that the onset of dementiarelated syndromes may be initiated by repetitive cerebral concussions in professional football players Studies have shown that "The purpose of our study was to investigate the association between previous head injury and the likelihood of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease in a unique group of retired professional football players with previous head injury exposure" With this being said it is an issue if head injuries are causing these issues

CTE and other issues have been a very serious issue being caused by severe brain damage in football According to ESPN "The brain of former Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher  the 25yearold player who shot and killed his girlfriend in 2012 before committing suicide  showed signs of pervasive brain damage like that found in other deceased NFL players according to a neuropathologist" With a lot of studies doctors were able to see that players with CTE or other brain damage have more chance to go out and act like this due to having so much brain damage 

 Helmets to help protect the players 
In the article Sports Law and Governance it talks about how over 2000 former NFL players are dealing with concussions later on in life The players are complaining and the league is getting sued for how the helmets have led players to have severe lifelong brain damage The NFL has been responding with a new "HIT" system helping players not get these problems so easily 

Wildman a sports scientist shows how much of an ongoing criticism is about NFL helmets and just helmets in general The NFL finally acknowledged the negative impact concussions have on its billiondollar business and opted to start awarding research grants geared toward finding a solution They are constantly trying to make better ways to protect the players without restraining them The newest thing being done on the helmets is to make them more like a car bumper

The Journal of Sociocultural Examanations of Sports Concussion it shows significant data on concussions and every way the NFL is trying to protect the players as much as they can No matter what it is they are always trying to figure out a new helmet or new material to use to make it a lot safer for players if they take a lot of big blows to the head area The article stated "suicides of former players linked to head trauma have combined to increase the public’s awareness about the potential dangers of concussions in all levels of football"  

 Prevention 
In October 2009 NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL Concussion Committee were called before Congress to defend their policies against allegations of neglect Goodell provided testimony but was unable to answer many questions as none of the primary authors of the leagues research Ira Casson David Viano or Elliot Pellman were present The policy expanded the list of symptoms that would prevent a player from returning to a game or practice on the same day their injury occurred

With continued pressure to protect players the NFL began preventing players knocked unconscious by a concussion from returning to a game or practice a policy that applied to Detroit Lions running back Jahvid Best in  Various players have filed lawsuits against the league for the concussions accusing the league of hiding information that linked head trauma to permanent brain damage Alzheimers disease and dementia Some teams chose not to draft certain players in the NFL Draft due to their past concussion history According to an Outside the Lines report the head impact telemetry system (HITS) was in question by the League although Kevin Guskiewicz a professor at the University of North Carolina said the system is functional Former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver and current NBC Sports analyst Hines Ward stated the use of the system would be "opening a Pandoras Box" and that the data recorded by the system could be used by team owners to give players lower salaries

In November 2011 the Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health created an online study released by the Journal of Neurosurgery in which various football helmets were compared with each other via crash test dummy
 Concussion protocol process 
When a American football
 Preseason evaluation 
Before the NFL season starts all players and coaching staff of an organization are required to be educated on concussions and the importance of promptly reporting any concussion symptoms All players in the league are also mandated to take a baseline neurological and Physical examination
 Ingame identification 
Current NFL concussion protocol creates positions in each organizations medical staff who are specifically charged with identifying and diagnosing concussions One of these roles involves an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant who work with other team physicians and athletic trainers to conduct evaluations Another position involves athletic trainers who are positioned in the booth at every game to spot potential concussions in players from both teams These spotters review film throughout the game that could possibly result in concussions and are capable to call "medical timeouts" to relay that information to the medical personnel on the sidelines so that further evaluation can be conducted These spotters have been in use since the 2011 NFL season
 Ingame evaluation 
If a player shows to have a concussion or concussion symptoms it is mandatory that the individual be removed from the game If the player is diagnosed with a concussion they are prohibited from reentering the game or practice that day According to the leagues protocol signs of a concussion include: loss of consciousness lack of balance holding head after contact absentmindedness lethargy confusion or a visible facial injury in combination with any of the other factors If the medical staff rule the player clear from a concussion then the video of that hit must be reviewed before the player can reenter the game or practice

 Postgame 
After a concussion has occurred the player must be monitored and examined on a daily basis in a training room by the team medical staff until fully cleared from concussion Along with the continuous examination prior to a concussion the player must meet standards that are in place by the league in order to return a game or contact practice The player may not return to football activities until he has returned to his baseline cognitive function Next the player must go through a graduated exercise challenge followed by a gradual return to practice and play If player is feeling any setback or post concussion symptoms evaluation then starts from the beginning Finally the team doctor and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant must both clear him for return to play

 NFL litigation 

Denial by the League
The NFL spent years trying to deny and cover up any link that emerged connecting head injuries sustained while playing football with longterm brain disorders The NFL Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee first formed in 1994 reported in December 1999 that the number of head injuries had remained "remarkably the same over the course of four years" The committee went a step further in 2004 when it suggested in an article published in Neurosurgery that "NFL players have evolved to a state where their brains are less susceptible to injury" Two months after that MTBI publishes another article that concludes "Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season" It was the first time any League official had acknowledged a link between the two

Things got worse for the NFL when investigative reporters Steve Fainaru and his brother Mike FainaruWada learned from an anonymous source that the NFL Retirement Board had awarded "disability payments to at least three former players after concluding that football caused their crippling brain injuries – even as the leagues top medical experts for years consistently denied any link between the sport and longterm brain damage" One of the cases was that of Mike Webster who filed a claim in 1999 In 2005 three years after his death his family received $18 million from the Retirement Board "That same year" write the Fainuru brothers "the NFL published the 10th installment in its series on concussions research in the medical journal Neurosurgery The paper whose authors included three members of the Leagues MTBI asserted that chronic brain injury has never been reported in American football players

Since Aiellos admittance the link between head injuries in football and longterm brain damage have become more accepted in the NFL In a roundtable discussion with the US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Jeff Miller the NFLs senior vicepresident for health and safety admitted that "there is a link between footballrelated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy" However public relations issues continue to plague the League A report from the Democratic members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said that "the NFL rescinded a gift to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for concussion research when it learned the studys findings would be detrimental to the leagues image" The NFL had tried to funnel the funds it gave to the NIH towards its own studies The League rejected the accusations

To mitigate the public relations (PR) nightmare the NFL has taken several steps to better assure player safety and bring awareness to head injuries in football players of all ages Several rule changes took place between 2007 and 2014 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell issued a memo in December 2009 to all 32 teams stating that a player who sustains a concussion cannot return to play if he shows signs or symptoms such as inability to remember assignments or plays a gap in memory and persistent dizziness This move changed the 2007 rule saying a player cannot return only if he has lost consciousness Additionally new rules regarding "crown of the helmet" tackles have been installed where a runner or a tackler cannot initiate forcible contact with the crown of the helmet outside the tackle box (American football)
The PR issues surrounding the NFLs coverup of concussions are far from over and it is too early to tell how and to what extent these events will impact the NFL or football playing Robert Boland professor of sports management at New York University and former college football player says "In the shortrun the NFL is still thriving" but downward trends in youth football players shows that future generations "might have less of an intimate attachment to the sport" Boland says this in light of Pop Warner football enrollment dropping by 95 percent between 2010 and 2012 likely linked to the highprofile concussion problem

Federal NFL concussion litigation
In April 2011 attorneys Sol H Weiss and Larry E Coben from the Philadelphia law firm of Anapol Weiss filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Ray Easterling Jim McMahon and five other players Thousands of former NFL players have since filed lawsuits against the League after suffering repeated concussions throughout their careers

The multidistrict litigation (MDL) titled In re: National Football League Players Concussion Injury Litigation (MDL 2323) was filed on January 31 2012 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Anita B Brody presides over the matter The master administrative longform complaint filed by Plaintiffs CoLead Counsel Sol Weiss and Christopher A Seeger
In April 2012 Easterling was found dead from a selfinflicted gunshot wound in his home An autopsy report concluded Easterlings brain had evidence of CTE a degenerative brain disease associated with frequent blows to the head

One month later former San Diego Chargers player Junior Seau also died of a selfinflicted gunshot wound and a brain autopsy showed he suffered from CTE

Like Easterling and Seau an autopsy of Bears safety Dave Duersons brain after he committed suicide earlier that year revealed he also suffered from the same degenerative brain disease

The autopsy results following these players suicides heightened existing concerns regarding the connection between player deaths and concussions Neuropathologist Bennet Omalu has identified CTE in the autopsies of former players Mike Webster Terry Long (American football)
In August 2012 the number of players involved in suits against the NFL increased to 3402 and the League sued three dozen insurance companies in an attempt to force them to cover the costs of defending claims of not protecting players However The Travelers Companies
After quarterbacks Jay Cutler Michael Vick and Alex Smith sustained concussions in Week 10 of the 2012 season the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) reiterated their plans to have independent neurologists on the sidelines at every game The 2013–14 NFL season involved an independent neurological consultant per team on the sideline of every game Concussion guidelines released by the NFL in 2013 mandated a fourstage protocol for concussions including examinations treatment and monitoring prior to a return to play In March 2013 the League proposed a rule to reduce concussions by making it illegal for a ball carrier or tackler to "initiate forcible contact by delivering a blow with the top crown of his helmet against an opponent when both players are clearly outside of the tackle box" However the proposal was met with criticism from players like running backs Matt Forte Emmitt Smith and Marshall Faulk

A federal hearing was held on April 9 2013 in Philadelphia to discuss the Leagues motion to dismiss the lawsuits brought on behalf of more than 4500 former players On July 8 2013 Judge Brody ordered representatives of both sides of the litigation to explore a possible settlement in the litigation Judge Brody ordered a report on or before September 3 2013 regarding the results of the mediation

A proposed settlement was reached in the litigation on August 29 2013 Under the agreement the NFL will contribute $765 million to provide medical help to more than 18000 former players Retired players who suffer severe neurological conditions such as Alzheimers and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diseases in the future will also be eligible to apply for medical help In addition $10 million will fund brain injury research as well as safety and education programs

The settlement says it should not be interpreted as a statement of legal liability on the part of the NFL

The settlement which is projected to protect retired players for nearly 65 years will compensate injured former players who need immediate help and will provide baseline assessments and medical benefits to those who are symptomfree or beginning to show signs of neurological problems

"I think its more important that the players have finality that theyre vindicated and that as soon as the court approves the settlement they can begin to get screening and those that are injured can get their compensation I think thats more important than looking at some documents" attorney Weiss said

The settlement also allows a player diagnosed with CTE the eligibility to up to 4 million dollars in compensation This has been met with criticism of the settlements structure as it only applies to players diagnosed before the settlements preliminary agreement and disallows those diagnosed after the approval of the deal in July

Controversy continues to surround the NFL response to concussive injuries among current and former players Although Mike Webster was the first patient to be diagnosed with CTE posthumously being the first diagnosed case and one of the higher profile cases illuminating the issue of head trauma injuries to the NFL his family has not received financial compensation from the NFL The reason for this is Websters died before January 1 2006 and in the terms of the NFLs settlement agreement the organization is only responsible for dispersing compensation payments to families of players who died from head related trauma and injuries from 2006 and beyond The Webster family is currently taking legal action against the National Football League with the goal of removing that qualification from the settlement

The NFL has paid nearly $1 billion in settlements from claims alleging longterm injuries from repeated blows to the head Courts have examined these claims using a "Trigger" process This trigger process includes 4 triggers: The "exposure" trigger the "manifestation" trigger the "injuryinfact" trigger and the "continuous" trigger

The dementia tests that the NFLapproved process used came under scrutiny in 2021 as black players were assumed to have a lower baseline cognitive function than nonblack players making it more difficult to prove dementia in their case  The practice was called "racenorming" by opponents  A lawsuit attempting to overturn the practice was thrown out in March 2021 and the judge ordered the parties to resolve it via mediation  In June 2021 the NFL announced it would end the practice and would form a panel of neuropsychologists to create new raceneutral standards

Kansas City Chiefs concussion lawsuit
On December 3 2013 five former NFL players filed a lawsuit against the Kansas City Chiefs organization: former Chiefs players Alexander Cooper (American football)
This lawsuit is unique and different from the thousands of lawsuits previously filed against the NFL These players are not suing the NFL and are instead suing the Chiefs

From 1987 to 1993 there was no Collective Bargaining Agreement established in the NFL With no existence of a CBA in these years players who played during this time for the Chiefs can sue the team for many of the same reasons the NFL has been sued The $765 million settlement in August 2013 between the NFL and former players only protected the NFL "I think all of our clients were disappointed" McClain said of his clients reaction to the settlement with the NFL The players gordon suing the Chiefs have all optedout of the settlement from the previous mediation with the NFL

A law unique to Missouri allows certain former NFL players to sue the individual team The current Missouri law states that employees can sue employers in civil court if the employees declined workers compensation The Independence attorney for the five exChiefs Ken McClain said "The lawsuit is allowed in Missouri after a state workers compensation statute was amended in 2005 to exclude cases of occupational injury that occur over an extended time"

The amendment of the 2005 law is set to be changed at the end of December 2013 Martin and McClain have both encouraged former players who are eligible to join the lawsuit before their window of opportunity expires

On December 1 2012 Jovan Belcher a thencurrent member of the Kansas City Chiefs shot and killed his fiancée Kassandra Perkins before committing suicide in the Arrowhead practice facility parking lot On behalf of Belchers and Perkins’ daughter lawyers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Chiefs Belchers mother has filed a similar suit accusing the Chiefs of ignoring Belchers cries for help as he complained of concussion like symptoms The first occurrence came against Jacksonville in 2009 where Belcher was knocked unconscious and failed to receive adequate treatment The second occurrence was against the Bengals in November 2012 The lawsuits allege Belcher "suffered what should have been recognized as an acute concussion" However one lawsuit continues "despite exhibiting obvious symptoms Decedent was never removed from play for evaluation and recovery" The lawsuits also claims Belcher exhibited signs of CTE including changes in his mood and behavior

On September 30 2014 it was announced that the brain of former Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher contained neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein; which is associated with CTE The tangles were distributed throughout Belchers hippocampus an area of the brain involved with memory learning and emotion If the findings of CTE come to be true Belchers daughter and mother are eligible for up to $4 million under the National Football Leagues current Collective Bargaining Agreement

Concussions in other leagues

NCAA Football

In the 2003 football season there was a reported 184 concussions out of the 4251 athletes that participated in that specific football season That is 63% of college football players have reported having a concussion This number does not include the athletes that fail to report they had a concussion Out of these athletes that reported their concussion and sat out of competition until released to participate again 65% of these athletes had another concussion occur in the same season  Concussions are known to be one of the most common injuries in College Football this is because of the constant contact to these athletes head Another reason these concussions are very likely to happen is because once a concussion is sustained it is very likely to happen again In fact an athlete that has sustained a concussion has a 351% chance of this injury reoccurring  The teams athletic trainers have specific guidelines for when their athletes sustain a concussion and they must follow these guidelines when diagnosing a concussion and also releasing a player to play after the initial diagnosis of the concussion Failure to follow the specific concussion protocol will result in harsh punishment against the university The athletic trainers do not have a specific guideline to how long it takes for their athletes to recover from these concussions when they feel their athlete is ready to undergo protocol to return to play is when they will test if their athlete is healthy enough to participate

Players that have suffered from the concussion the average of their age was 195 years of age and they had an estimated 84 years of experience Players that have suffered two or more concussions were slightly younger at 191 years of age and had some more experience at 91 years of participation This supports the statement that athletes with more exposure to these helmet to helmet hits will be more prone to concussions For example a quarterback that is hit the least amount on the football fields only suffers concussions around 56% of the reported concussions opposed to offensive lineman that suffers about 209% of the reported concussions  The more that the head is exposed to these hits makes these athletes more susceptible to these head injuries These injuries do happen in practice have been known to happen more often during the participation of a game This is because the athletes are playing with full effort and the hits are more severe therefore the chances of concussion rise significantly

Canadian Football League
In the 2010 CFL season Team physicians and therapists are to use a SCAT2 (a medical protocol) to diagnose concussions and preventing athletes from playing until they have been cleared to play
 All players are to be submitted to IMPACT which is a form of cognitive testing during training camp
 All player concussion assessments in the CFL are to only be used by team physicians and therapists
 All coaches and players will receive educational items to aid in recognizing signs of a concussion
 Administrators are to report a change from the expectation that a player returns to the game to one that encourages players to be honest about symptoms
 The formation of certification programs that teach coaches how to recognize the symptoms of concussions
 The formation of training programs for coaches that emphasize that players should never use their helmets to tackle
 A new rule in the amateur football rulebook was implemented that requires officials to report suspected concussed players to the coaching or medical staff during games

In 2012 ThinkFirst founder and Toronto Western Hospital neurosurgeon Charles Tator led a study that was conducted by the University of Toronto which examined the brains of 20 former players with a history of concussions and compared them to 20 other players without a history of head injury A separate group of 20 without football experience served as a control group Also in 2012 the league and Tator announced a partnership to work in a study that would perform postmortem tests on former CFL players to look for signs of CTE

Arena Football League
In the Arena Football League despite the leagues intense play very few lawsuits have been filed for concussions The most notable lawsuit against the league was a lawsuit filed by former Colorado Crush kicker Clay Rush in 2010 who claimed that he suffered from permanent brain damage due to repeated blows to the head during games Like the NFL the AFL prohibits players who suffered from concussions from practicing In 2008 during the original leagues 2008 Arena Football League season


Youth football
Youth athletes make up 70% of football players in the United States Every year there are 23000 nonfatal traumatic brain injuries stemming from playing football that required an emergency visit to the hospital  Of those visits 90% of them are children between the ages of 5–18 years old

A study conducted from 2010 to 2014 showed that of the 529 million emergency room visits; 819000 were contact sport related This accounted for 015% of all emergency visits This number although small may affect and cause ramifications in the American healthcare system These figures are represented with nearly 8090% of that of the youth population (ages 7–18)

One of the first studies of its kind was performed during the Fall 2011 football season when researchers from Virginia Tech receiving permission from parents placed accelerometers (which measure g forces) inside the helmets of seven youth players These seven players were 7 and 8yearold boys participating in a community youth league who were chosen because they were expected to have high participation and also because they wore at least a youth medium Riddell Sports Group Inc
As way of comparison a collision of 80g is a big hit in a college football game of which there might be only six per game And the range of 80 90 or 100g is generally where risk of acute injury and concussion begins to occur (concussion being symptoms such as feeling foggy or woozy and not necessarily loss of consciousness) An example of a lesser force of 40g is heading a soccer ball and even with blows in this 30 to 40g range it is not known whether these pose a cumulative risk of injury

This 2011 study measured a total 753 impacts among these seven players with a median impact of 15g It did however observe 38 impacts of 40g or greater and six impacts of greater than 80g Fortunately none of these youth players experienced a concussion There is also a concern that since many young players have less developed chest and neck muscles than older players almost every impact potentially acts likes a surprise hit

A Virginia Tech doctor stated that reducing the number of higher hits during practice sessions constitutes a real opportunity Of the 38 impacts of 40g or greater 29 took place during practice And of the six impacts greater than 80g all took place during practice

One Pop Warner Little Scholars
The Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDCs) has developed the "Heads Up concussion in Youth Sports" It helps youth coaches players and parents be more aware of a concussion Heads up provides important information on preventing recognizing and responding to a concussion 63% of youth coaches viewed concussions being more serious 72% said they are educating others about concussions and 50% had learned something new

According to the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) kids who begin playing football before the age of twelve are at a greater risk of depression behavioral regulation apathy and executive functioning Michael Alosco PhD lead author for the (BUSM) states "This study adds to growing research suggesting that incurring repeated head impacts through tackle football before the age of 12 can lead to a greater risk for short and longterm neurological consequences"

Concussions in high school football
Concussions are frequent in high school football Football has the highest rate of concussion among high school sports with about 11 concussions occurring per 10000 athletic exposures About 50 high school or younger football players across the country were killed or sustained serious head injuries on the field since 1997

Many concussions that occur during high school football often go untreated and are not monitored This is a big concern because repeated trauma to the head especially injuries with concussion like symptoms puts a young athletes health at serious risk  A 2013 study by Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center found that despite knowing the risk of serious injury from continuing to play with a concussion half of high school football players would still play if they had a headache from an injury sustained on the field Researchers surveyed 120 high school football players Of those students 30 reported having suffered a concussion More than 90 percent recognized the risk of serious injury if they returned to play too quickly but more than half of those aware of the risks responded they would "always or sometimes continue to play with a headache sustained from an injury" and only 54 percent indicated they would "always or sometimes report symptoms of a concussion to their coach" Another study found that 158% of football players who sustain a concussion severe enough to cause loss of consciousness return to play the same day Due to the fact that only 42% of high schools have access to athletic training services there has been a large debate regarding the risks that high school football players face

Eleven high schools in North Central Florida agreed to take a written questionnaire evaluating the varsity football teams knowledge about concussions The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects by the University of Florida The review consisted of three sections First was to identify symptoms of a concussion second what they believed were possible consequences from not getting the proper treatment of a concussion and the last section was to indicate if they have ever received information about concussions 25% of them had never received information about concussion and only 54% had talked about the issue of a concussion with a parent

Prevention efforts
Numerous efforts have attempted to identify potential concussions quickly Helmet shock data loggers and impact sensors help monitor impacts a player receives  One example is a device created by Schutt Sports during the Arena Football Leagues 2008 season known as the "Shockometer"—a triangleshaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players helmets When a player gets hit by a gforce which exceeds 98 a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light Doctors have determined that a gforce of approximately 100 will increase the risk of a concussion even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a gforce of 150 g A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device Riddell Sports Group Inc
NFL
Sean Morey (American football)
Since then the National Football League has made numerous rule changes to reduce the number of concussions suffered by players while making the game safer

In 2010 the NFL reworded the Leagues rules to prohibit a player from "launching himself off the ground and using his helmet to strike a player in a defenseless posture in the head or neck" Violations of this rule only result in the imposition of a 15yard unnecessary roughness penalty In the same season the NFL mandated that once a player loses his helmet on the playing field the current play must immediately be whistled dead

Also in 2010 the NFL mandated that during field goals or extra point attempts defenders must line up with their entire bodies on the outside of the snappers body to protect the snapper while he is in a position of vulnerability Violations of this rule however result in only a fiveyard penalty for illegal formation

The Competition Committee reviews all competitive aspects of the game including playing rules roster regulations technology gameday operations and player protection The process for modifying or adopting rules and regulations is systematic and consensusoriented

To reinforce the seriousness of the rule changes in the middle of the 2010 season Commissioner Goodell issued a memo to all NFL teams stating that "more significant discipline including suspensions will be imposed on players that strike an opponent in the head or neck area in violation of the rules"

The most drastic step the NFL has taken to reduce head injuries was the 2010 change to the NFL kickoff rules To reduce what has been referred to as one of the most violent plays in the game the kickoff was moved up from the 30yard line to the 35yard line The NFL also outlawed the use of the threeman wedge on kickoffs while allowing the twoman wedge to remain a legal play Consequently players on the kicking team must now line up closer to midfield reducing the amount of space the players have in which to get a running start

In 2011 the NFL also mandated that certified athletic trainers be available in press boxes during all NFL games These athletic trainers assist medical personnel located on the sidelines in identifying potential concussions because the symptoms are often difficult to spot and assess from the field level

On March 20 2013 the NFL voted to introduce yet another new rule aimed at player safety Starting in the 2013–2014 season if a running back lowers the crown of his helmet while he is inside the tackle box or while he is less than three yards downfield and makes contact with a defender the team will be given a 15yard penalty

After three years of declines in reported cases the 2015 regular season contained a spike in reported concussions even after making several safety improvements the previous year The total cases reported for the practices preseason and regular season was 271 a 316 percent spike The 2015 cases reported for regular season games was 182 a 583 percent spike

In the 2016 offseason the NFL implemented a new policy to their concussion protocol The NFL can now punish teams that do not follow their concussion protocol by imposing a monetary fine or taking away their draft picks The first violation can be a fine up to $150000 and the second violation can be a fine no less than $100000 and a possible removal of draft picks In 2017 the Seattle Seahawks were under much scrutiny for violating the NFLs concussion protocol by allowing Russell Wilson to return to the game against the Arizona Cardinals without the proper treatment The Seattle Seahawks failed to have Wilson cleared by a team doctor and an independent physician before allowing him to return to the game The NFL investigated the incident and imposed a $100000 fine on the Seahawks

WFA
The Womens Football Alliance has come a long way when it comes to the guidelines on making the game safer for its players

From 2012 to 2017 they have since made it illegal to send a player back into the game with suspicions of a concussion unless cleared by a certified health official

Youth football
Return to play guidelines (RTPs) such as Washington States Lystedt Law have been legally mandated since 2009  All 50 states and Washington DC have now passed legislation to help reduce the number of traumatic brain injuries in youth football

Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois introduced the Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act on September 25 2013 to the US Senate  This act would require athletes parents coaches and school officials to be informed of the risks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and it would also require the "when in doubt sit it out" policy to be used with athletes that have been suspected of having a concussion and be removed from the field of play  A press release from Senator Durbin stated that many major US sports organizations including the NFL and NHL endorsed the bill

In 2016 the Pop Warner Little Scholars
Screening procedure


In September 2015 researchers with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
As of February 2015 Gary Small and colleagues have been called into question by the FDA for their overzealous commercialization and promotion of clinically unproven screening that fellow peer researchers deem fit only for research and they have responded by withdrawing related materials from their website

To date all screening procedures that examine football players for brain damage have been post mortem In 2013 Gary Small and colleagues developed an in vivo chemical tracer that can detect tau protein build up in living players Small and his team invented this new chemical tracer 2(1<nowiki/>ethylidene)malononitrile or FDDNP that could be used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans This new tracer measures for tau protein and amyloid plaque accumulation in human brains; symptoms of repetitive brain trauma among other things Although tracers have been developed to screen for the buildup of tau proteins in the human brain FDDNP is the first PET tracer that can be used in vivo in human trials FDDNP was originally developed in an effort to detect Alzheimers in elderly individuals thus the article was published in the The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry
Small and colleagues performed a controlled experiment on retired NFL players and an equal number of control participants Unfortunately the sample size was very small as only 5 players of the 19 contacted were eligible for the study Though the sample size was small a good range of positions were represented (linebacker quarterback offensive lineman defensive lineman and a center) and all players had played in the league at least 10 years The players had to be at least 45 years of age and currently exhibit symptoms of cognitive and mood disruption Control participants had to meet certain criteria as well to ensure that they were as similar as possible to the NFL players in order to eliminate any biases or confounding variables Age Body Mass Index (BMI) years of education and family history of dementia were all selected as the selection criteria for control participants All participants received intravenous injections of the FDDNP tracer and were tested over 4 weeks using PET imaging technology

The injection of the FDDNP tracer was successful and the results of the study showed significant differences between the NFL players and control participants The NFL players had significantly higher FDDNP signals than control participants indicating a greater amount of tau protein accumulation The cortical regions of all the participants studied showed no significant difference but the NFL players had FDDNP levels that were significantly higher in the caudate putamen thalamus sub thalamus midbrain and cerebellar white matter regions of the brain as compared to the control participants In addition a positive correlation was found between the number of head injuries the players sustained and the levels of FDDNP binding This suggests that players with a more severe history of head trauma will likely have significantly more accumulation of tau protein This in turn gives rise to the suggestion that a more severe history of head trauma will result in greater deterioration of the brain cognitive functioning and mood regulation

The findings of the study were consistent with previous autopsy studies of individuals with CTE The important distinction to make however is that the patients in Smalls study were not on the slab and walked out after testing was completed This is monumental in the field of brain trauma and concussion research

Based on recent new blood tests; evidence is revealing no change in blood plasma tau and serum neurofilament light concentrations following sport related concussions However these levels did rise in more severe concussion sport related injuries This can potentially suggest that a new blood test be developed and help aid in identifying the severity of concussion and assist in concussion protocols

Recovery efforts
Concussions are proven to cause loss of brain function This can lead to physical and emotional symptoms such as attention disorders depression headaches nausea and amnesia These symptoms can last for days or weeks and even after the symptoms have gone the brain still will not be completely normal Players with multiple concussions can have drastically worsened symptoms and exponentially increased recovery time

Researchers at UCLA used a brainimaging tool to identify a certain protein found in five retired NFL players The presence and accumulation of tau proteins found in the five living players are associated with Alzheimers disease Previously this type of exam could only be performed with an autopsy Scientists at UCLA created a chemical marker that binds to the abnormal proteins and they are able to view this with positron emission tomography (PET) scan Researcher at UCLA Gary Small explains "Providing a noninvasive method for early detection is a critical first step in developing interventions to prevent symptom onset and progression in Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
Postconcussive symptoms (PCS) is an area of recovery that is often not discussed New evidence suggest that new recovery protocols have been recommended and designed to more adequately and efficiently recover from concussions PCS is a concussion symptom lasting longer than 14 days Current protocols suggest that the athlete refrain from any physical activity until symptoms free However according to the Journal of Athletic Training "a physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sportrelated concussion" suggests some aerobic activity may be beneficial to more appropriate healing from concussion and may lessen the reoccurrence of repeated concussions

There has been promising evidence that blood flow restriction based exercises can be used to improve PostConcussion Syndrome (PCS) "The leading theory supporting this is that human growth hormone is released in response to increased lactate production from exercise enhancing the brain function and recovery" This exercise based program could potentially be used in conjunction with aerobic therapy to better improve concussion symptoms during the recovery process

As of 2011 all 32 NFL teams are required to have at least one Physical Therapist on staff Physical Therapist can help with current and former NFL players that have experienced a concussion A Vestibular Physical Therapist can create customized treatment for dizziness and balance dysfunction associated with a concussion
