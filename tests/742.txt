UNESCO Global Geoparks Network (GGN) as of 2020 

A geopark is a protected area with internationally significant geology within which Sustainability
In 2005 a European Geopark was defined as being:
"a territory with a particular geological heritage and with a sustainable territorial developmentthe ultimate aim of a European Geopark is to bring enhanced employment opportunities for the people who live there"

Today the geopark is virtually synonymous with the UNESCO geopark which is defined and managed under the voluntary authority of UNESCOs International Geoscience Programme
The list of members is not the same as the member states of the United Nations Membership in the UN does not automatically imply membership of UNESCO even though UNESCO is part of the UN Both lists have about 193 member nations but not exactly the same 193 The UN list covers most of the geopolitical world but the UNESCO list lacks Israel for example which resigned in 2018 because they believed UNESCO is antiIsrael

The UNESCO Global Geoparks
The Madonie Declaration of 2004 which was signed by Nikolas Zouros for the EGN and Wolfgang Eder for UNESCO established what was later called a "bottom up" system of precedence An applicant geopark must first be a member of the EGN before applying to the UGGN Furthermore another level was created the National Geoparks Network which at first glance seems a contradiction in terms Geoparks are international What the Declaration meant was if a potentially international type of site (a possible geosite) existed within the candidate parks country the park must belong to it before it can apply to the regional network This type was dubbed an NGN Its sites could then be included under the geopark umbrella by being candidates for the international network In 2014 the creation of other regions besides the EGN was allowed and encouraged permitting geoparks to fulfill their declared global nature

Etymology and usage of geopark
List of Greek and Latin roots in English/G
Produced words are often open to interpretation: they mean whatever the writer intended them to mean or whatever the reader interpreted them to mean Eventually the word receives a common understanding that can be dictionarydefined "Geopark" is right at that point Henriques and Brilha after listing four interpretations not to be allowed now cite features that must be present in the application of "geopark:" a development plan a geoheritage conservation and sustainability These are features that must receive the credibility of the international organizations certifying the park as a geopark without which certification they cannot be scientific geoparks The overall qualification therefore is that they must be certified as geoparks by the accepted international organizations No certification no geopark

The innovation of geocompounds is neither new or recent the most ancient perhaps being the geometria "earth measurement" of ancient Greece There have been a smattering of "Earth" words ever since Geologia is a relative newcomer in mediaeval Latin "the study of earthly things" (such as law) in contrast to divine things It was preempted to refer to the 18th century topics of fossils and rock stratification Most geocompounds come from the 19th and early 20th century Geo means "Earth" rather than "geological" which would be redundant 

After a floruit of international exploration scientific research and parkbuilding in the later 19th century the world wars represent a sharp decline of conservation and tourism as the goals of war are opposite those of peace Even the League of Nations predecessor of the United Nations did not unite The last world war saw the irrecoverable destruction of national heritages and the terrible misuse of science The United Nations and its and educational scientific and cultural branch UNESCO heir to the Leagues International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation both founded in 1945 to do a better job at peacekeeping and cooperation were at first hindered by the Cold War As it manifestly drew to an end in the 1970s and the countries of east Europe would be open once more UNESCO began to be more effective formulating organizations to respond to a growing demand for the protection of the heritage that was left

The current round of innovation to which geopark belongs dates to the last decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st although it may not be over yet They began as marketing terms in the vending of what Farsani calls "sustainable tourism" characterizing it as "a new niche market" the key words being in addition to geopark geotourism geoheritage Geotope
The term “geopark” was apparently first used to describe a newly instituted park in the west Vulkaneifel  district of the Eifel Mountains of RhinelandPalatinate Germany The region had tended to be economically depressed due to the preference of buyers and sellers for markets in nearby France They did have a noted geological asset: a now dormant forested volcanic range The land shows evidence of ancient volcanos including crater lakes mineral springs and pipe formations The place also abounds in fossils Although of interest to scientists and hikers the terrain was generally regarded as a liability some 19thcentury plans even having been made to fill lakes
<!Geoconservation timeline
File:Fossil Tree Stumps at Fossil Grove Glasgow 1977jpgAfter pointing out that the "origins of geoheritage conservation" have long been under debate Du and Girault two historians of geoconservation at the National Museum of Natural History Paris in a brief survey of the current literature distinguish three historical phases of "geoconservation activity" 

Unsystematic conservation
The oldest is unsystematic protection of individual sites For example the earliest known of modern times is the decree of Rudolph Augustus Duke of BraunschweigWolfenbüttel ruler of a small German principality in 1668 that Baumannshöhle Cave in the Harz Mountains was to be conserved The practice of singling out geosites for individual protection subsequently spread through Denmark Switzerland Belgium and the British Isles

Systematic national conservation

Du’s and Girault’s next historical phase is  “systematic process of geoconsevation”  Going beyond the protection of an individual site the applicable government intends “to assess geological heritage sites of particular significance for research education and training as well as entertainment and aesthetic enjoyment” that is to say instead of merely reacting to single sites brought to their attention the government is proactively seeking out sites that fit a sustainable geotype

The earliest paradigm of systematic protection is the national park  system of the United States stimulated by the acquisition of large tracts of public western lands that must be surveyed and dealt with as opposed to Europe especially Britain where the land was already privately owned

American systematic conservation however is not geoconservation in the vocabulary of sustainable parks Although parallel to and prior to European geoconservation it does not lead directly to any geoparks under an international authority There are no doubt mutual influences but the emphasis of geoparks is on sustainabilty the ability to stay "in the black" by marketing natural assets while American parks are a public service regardless of whether they make money The Americans in fact do not participate in any geoparks program have no geoparks and resigned from UNESCO in 2018 They are conspicuously absent from geoconservational timelines Conservation however is a primary goal

The code declares (Article 1a1) that the concern of the service is “the national park system” which comprises 
:“superlative natural historic and recreation areas in every major region of the United States” 

The areas themselves are not a system of any kind but the law adds a unity of national intent: 
:“these areas though distinct in character are united through their interrelated purposes and resources into one national park system as cumulative expressions of a single national heritage …”

They derive 
:“increased national dignity and recognition … through their inclusion jointly … in one national park system” 

The responsibility of the service is therefore (Article 1) to  
:“promote and regulate the use of the Federal areas known as national parks monuments and reservations … by such means and measures as conform to the fundamental purpose … which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same … “ 

The unity of intent and sustainability at the national level are thus explicitly addressed

Systematic international conservation
The movement assumed international proportions with the holding of an international convention in 1988 in Amsterdam Scientists from only a few nations attended Germany was interested in conserving its scenic Rhine River terrain with its castles the toll stations of another age The first geopark was founded in Germany 1989  In 1991 in Digne France a considerably expanded convention set out a platform for international cooperation in establishing geoparks In 2015 UNESCO changed its name to UNESCO Global Geoparks which supports and advises the establishment of geoparks by member countries but not necessarily only them>

Types of geopark
The word geopark is no longer open to the process of innovation through word production It has been defined by various organizations in the field of earth science An essential element of the definition is that a geopark must be branded as part of an international geopark network A national park is not necessarily a geopark For example the United States has a system of national parks but none of them are geoparks Canada on the other hand has several

A geopark network requires the branding of an international scientific association They only brand protected areas that meet certain standards as presented above The branding has no effect on the previous status of an area It might already have been other types of park such as a national park If the geopark branding is removed it is still those other types of park No matter what the type management the exercise of authority over the area is always national; the scientific organizations have no sovereignity; they are simply advisory and certifying agencies guided by decisions made at international conventions

National geoparks
A "national geopark" is a post de facto designation by UNESCO of a "geographical area" or a transnational geographical area already known to be "of international regional and/or national importance" as a candidate geopark It has not yet been certified as belonging to a regional or the global UNESCO geopark network It has been "already inscribed" as a member of some other network; that is "national geopark" is a sort of floating candidacy that can be attached to any other parkland of interest after which attachment the parkland qualifies for the designation of geopark The candidates so designated are termed a "national network for geoparks" If it exists in a member nation all geoparks of the regional network in that nation as well as the global network must also belong to it

Some of the networks from which UNESCO national geoparks might be chosen are World Heritage Sites Agenda 21 Man and the Biosphere Programme UNESCO also provides a list of recommended geosite types such as "minerals and mineral resources" "fossils" etc

The national networks (one for each nation) are intended as the bottom level of the bottomup system They support national conservation education cultural development research as well as economic sustainability There is some effort to control conflict of mandate; for example Fossils are not allowed to be sold which practice would favor sustainability but work against conservation For some geoparks such as Sitia geopark (east Crete) the conflict between geotourist development and the conservation of archaeological sites is a severe one reaching the law courts As with the other levels of geopark the parks are subject to review for recertification every four years


Transnational geoparks
A transnational geopark crosses a national border to extend continuously in two member nations The park must belong to two national geoparks one in each nation and one regional geopark Both national geoparks collaborate to prepare a single application which is submitted by both to the regional and global networks Both member nations must endorse the park The management bodies in each nation must collaborate to establish a single set of activities and strategies for the entire park They can appoint either two collaborating managements or one management<ref>cite web 

The certified transnational geoparks are:

 Geopark Karawanken
 Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark
 Novohrad – Nógrád Geopark
 Muscau Arch / Łuk Mużakowa UNESCO Global Geopark

Regional geoparks
A regional geopark is a member of an independent network of geoparks that has agreed with UNESCO to provide candidates for the global network All members of the regional network are a priori members of a national geopark network They are also members of the global network if they are certified for it A regional geopark would not be a global geopark if it has not yet been certified as such or its certification has lapsed and it has applied for recertification (Yellow Card status)

A region is more than one country A current list of accepted regions is:
African Geoparks Network
Asia Pacific Geoparks Network (APGN)
European Geoparks Network (EGN)
Latin America and the Caribbean Geoparks Network (LACGN)

Acting regional geopark
Canada has some geoparks The most logical regional classification for these might have been the "North American Regional Geopark Network" following a proposed continental tradition for geopark regions However the United States does not have any geoparks and Mexico is covered under Latin America There are no other nations in North America that can be combined into a region The United States and Israel resigned from UNESCO in 2018 because they believed that UNESCO is antiIsrael though the US rejoined in 2023

Canadian geoparks according to the rules must belong to a regional network before they can apply for global status but there is none and may not be any in the foreseeable future UNESCO therefore treating Canada as a special case allows the national geoparks network the Canadian Geoparks Network to give global and green card certification A regionalization based strictly on continents did not turn out to be practical for other regions also


UNESCO Global Geoparks

A global geopark is one that has been certified to the fullest extent and is therefore a member of UNESCOs global network of geoparks It is per se also a member of a regional geopark network and also a member of a national geopark network if its nation has one or a transnational geopark A certification is good for four years after which it must be certified again In the language of certification a recertified global geopark is termed a "greencard geopark" If a geopark fails recertification it is given two years to pass in which it is a "yellowcard geopark" After two years if it is still unrecertified it is a "redcard geopark;" that is no longer a geopark and is removed from connection with or concern by UNESCO To reapply it must start the application over Recertified geoparks do not have to keep the same borders; only a portion may be recertified
