Futurism is a Modernist literature
Methodology
 Intuition 
File:Filippo Tommaso Marinetti  Zang tumb tumb  Hoge Rijndijk 8 LeidenJPGIn Marinettis 1909 manifesto Marinetti calls for the reawakening of "divine intuition" that "after hours of relentless toil" allows for the "creative spirit seems suddenly to shake off its shackles and become prey to an incomprehensible spontaneity of conception and execution"

Soffici had a more earthly reasoning Intuition was the means by which creation took place He believed that there could be no abstraction of the values of futurist literature in logical terms Rather art was a language in and of itself that could only be expressed in that language Any attempt to extrapolate from the literature resulted "in the evaluation not of artistic qualities but of extraneous matters" As such the spontaneous creation brought by intuition freed one from abstracting (and therefore adding erroneous material into the literature) and allowed on to speak in the language of art

In this way Futurists rallied against "intellectualistic literature…and intelligible poetry"  However this idea is different from antiintellectualism They were not hostile to intellectual approaches but just the specific intellectual approach that poetry had taken for so many years Therefore they often rejected any form of tradition as it had been tainted with the previous intellectual approaches of the past

 Analogy 

Analogys purpose in Futurist writing was to show that everything related to one another They helped to unveil this true reality lying underneath the surface of existence That is to say despite what the experience might show one everything is in fact interconnected The more startling the comparison the more successful it is

The means for creating these analogies is intuition This intuition is "the poets peculiar quality in that it enables him to discover analogies which hidden to reason are yet the essentials of art" The discovering of analogies is made possible by intuition

Now Marinetti believed that analogies have always existed but earlier poets had not reached out enough to bring appropriately disparate entities together By creating a communion of two (or more) seemingly unrelated objects the poet pierces to the "essence of reality" The farther the poet has to reach in terms of logical remoteness is in direct proportion to its efficacy

As analogy thus plays such an important role it "offers a touchstone to gauge poetical values…: the power to startle The artistic criterion derived from analogy is stupefaction" While an ordinary persons vision is colored by convention and tradition the poet can brush away this top layer to reveal the reality below The process of communicating the surprise is art while the "stupefaction" is the reaction to this discovery Thus analogies are the essence of poetry for the Futurists

 Irony 

As the Futurists advocated the aforementioned intuition and the bucking of tradition one might assume that they would suppress the use of irony On the contrary irony proved to be "so old and forgotten that it looked almost new when the dust was brushed away from it What was new and untried at least more so than their principles and theories were the futurists stylistic devices"

 Abolition of syntax 

Futurists believed that the constraints of syntax were inappropriate to modern life and that it did not truly represent the mind of the poet Syntax would act as a filter in which analogies had to be processed and so analogies would lose their characteristic "stupefaction" By abolishing syntax the analogies would become more effective 
The practical realization of this ideal meant that many parts of speech were discarded: Adjectives were thought to bring nuance in "a universe which is…black and white"; the infinitive provided all the idea of an action one needed without the hindrances of conjugation; substantives followed their linked substantives without other words (by the notion of analogy) Punctuation moods and tenses also disappeared in order to be consistent with analogy and "stupefaction"

However the Futurists were not truly abolishing syntax White points out that since "The OED defines syntax as the arrangement of words in their proper forms by which their connection and relation in a sentence are shown" The Futurists were not destroying syntax in that sense Marinetti in truth advocated a number of "substantial but nevertheless selective modifications to existing syntax" and that the "Russian Futurists idea that they were shaking syntax loose" is more accurate

 Metrical reform 

Early Futurist poetry relied on free verse as their poetical vehicle However free verse "was too thoroughly bound up with tradition and too fond of producing…stale effects" to be effective Furthermore by using free verse the Futurist realized they would be working under the rules of syntax and therefore interfering with intuition and inspiration

In order to break free of the shackles of meter they resorted to what they called "parole in libertá (word autonomy)" Essentially all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern instead of the meter In this way the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation and metrics that allowed for free expression

For example in the poem entitled "Studio" by Soffici he "describes the artists studio—and by extension modern man himself—as becoming a radiotelefantastic cabin open to all messages the sense of wonder her being transmitted by the portmanteau neologism: readotelefantastica" Here all notions of familiar language have been abandoned and in their place a new language has emerged with its own vocabulary

 Onomatopoeia 
There were four forms of onomatopoeia that the Futurists advocated: direct indirect integral and abstract The first of these four is the usually onomatopoeia seen in typical poetry eg boom splash tweet They convey the most realistic translation of sound into language Indirect onomatopoeia "expressed the subjective responses to external conditions"

Integral onomatopoeia was "the introduction of any and every sound irrespective of its similarity to significant words" This meant that any collection of letters could represent a sound The final form of onomatopoeia did not reference external sounds or movements like the aforementioned versions of onomatopoeia Rather they tried to capture the internal motions of the soul

 Essential/synthetic lyricism 

In order to better provide stark contrasting analogies the Futurist literature promoted a kind of hyperconciseness It was dubbed essential and synthetic lyricism The former refers to a paring down of any and all superfluous objects while the latter expresses an unnatural compactness of the language unseen elsewhere This idea explains where poetry became the preferred literary medium of Futurism and why there are no Futurist novels (since novels are neither pared down nor compressed)

 Futurism in the theatre 

Traditional theatre often served as a target for Futurists because of its deep roots in classical societies In its stead the Futurists exalted the Variety show
By adding other Futurist ideals mentioned above they firmly rooted their beliefs into theatre They wanted to blur the line between art and life in order to reach below the surface to reality In practice this manifested itself in various ways:

:"Collaboration between the public and the actors was to be developed to the point of indistinction of roles—such cooperating confusion was to be partly impromptu…eg chairs were to be covered with glue so that ladies gowns would stick to them; and tickets sold in such a way as to bring side by side men of the extreme right and those of the extreme left prudes and prostitutes teachers and pupils Sneezing powders sudden darkening of the hall and alarm signals were all means to insure the proper functioning of this universal human farce"

However the most important aspect of the work was the discrediting of the great works of theatre These new theatrical ideal of the Futurists helped to establish a new genre of theatre: the synthetic play

 Synthetic play 

This type of play took the idea of compression to an extreme where "a brief performance in which entire acts were reduced to a few sentences and scenes to a handful of words No sentiments no psychological development no atmosphere no suggestiveness Common sense was banished or rather replaced by nonsense" There did exist some plays similar to this before the Futurists but they did not conform to the Futurist agenda The creator of the first modern synthetic play is thought to be Verlaine with his aptly titled work Excessive Haste

 Futurism in Art Work 
It took some time during the development of the movement to take shape in all the areas the futurists wanted to explore in order to visually represent their message especially in twodimensional paintings Their hybridstyle of human and machine or showing a forward motion was common due to their worship of the modern machine and technology One of the most popular representations of this is in the piece "Dynamism of the dog by Giacomo Balla This piece shows a dog being walked on a lease and rather than the typical fourlegged representation the dog has mutliple feet in a swishing type motion to suggest movement This piece along with the others that followed was referred to as "Dynamism": "No single object is separate from its background or another object"

 Examples 
Excerpt from Marinettis free verse poem To a Racing Car

Veemente dio d’una razza d’acciaio<br />
Automobile ebbra di spazio<br />
che scalpiti e fremi d’angoscia<br />
rodendo il morso con striduli denti<br />
Formidabile mostro giapponese<br />
dagli occhi di fucina<br />
nutrito di fiamma<br />
e d’olî minerali<br />
avido d’orizzonti di prede siderali<br />
Io scateno il tuo cuore che tonfa diabolicamente<br />
scateno i tuoi giganteschi pneumatici<br />
per la danza che tu sai danzare<br />
via per le bianche strade di tutto il mondo!

Vehement god from a race of steel<br />
Automobile drunk with space<br />
Trampling with anguish bit between your strident teeth!<br />
O formidable Japanese monster with forge<br />
Nourished with flame and mineral oils<br />
Hungry for horizons and sidereal prey<br />
I unleash your heart to the diabolical vroomvroom<br />
And your giant radials for the dance<br />
You lead on the white roads of the world

Farfas parole in Libertá poem Triangle

they were three three<br />
the he and the other the other<br />
and the other was a real triangle a true<br />
younger brother of the file<br />
of steel rusty stell<br />
that he in the frenzy<br />
of possession only his only his alone<br />
seized abruptly and thrust theeeeere<br />
into the pure white velvet of her belly<br />
plugging her new opening with his flesh<br />
with his virile flesh<br />
ah ah ah<br />
ahh ahh ahh<br />
ahe haaaahh
