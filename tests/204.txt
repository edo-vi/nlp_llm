For example <math>A</math> could be gender race or any other characteristics that we want to be free of bias while <math>Y</math> would be whether the person is qualified for the degree and the output <math>R</math> would be the schools decision whether to offer the person to study for the degree In this context higher university enrollment rates of African Americans compared to whites with similar test scores might be necessary to fulfill the condition of equalized odds if the "base rate" of <math>Y</math> differs between the groups

The concept was originally defined for binaryvalued <math>Y</math> In 2017 Woodworth et al generalized the concept further for multiple classes
