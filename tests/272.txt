Semiotics of music videos is the observation of Symbolism (arts)
Overview<!Mesomusica redirects here>
Semiotics in popular music or mesomusica<!boldface per WP:RPLA> is different from semiotics in other musical forms because pop music denotes a cultural object (Matusitz 2004) Popular music has many signs in itself because it has many components and uses but it also appeals to the emotions of a generation Music is the “logical expression” of feelings a "symbolic form" Music videos are an example of syntagm wherein interacting sign (semiotics)
There are early critics of the importance of analyzing music videos as a semiotic system Frederic Jamesons definition of music videos is as a schizophrenic string of isolated discontinued signifiers failing to link up into a coherent sequence thus a string without a center

Invisible editing
Many semiotic analysts have examined music videos to decode messages that are being sent to viewers

Invisible editing (a semiotic term) refers to what film editors use to almost decode a songs message for the audience through narrative actions Daniel Chandlers example from famous film editor Ralph Rosenblum describes this progression: "a man awakens suddenly in the middle of the night bolts up in bed stares ahead intensely and twitches his nose Then the film directs towards a room where two people are desperately fighting a billowing blaze" (Chandler pp&nbsp;166 2007) Because of the actions of the actors the audience is aware of the next scene before it is shown

Other examples of invisible editing in music videos are in a more formal narrative style consisting of a plot or storyline of events and characters Music videosmaking that use a narrativestyle script is considered as the more formal approach because the editing involved adds emphasis to the songs chorus giving it a deeplyingrained musical archetype Michael Jacksons Thriller (music video)
In contrast music videos that arent formally organized may have no segmentation markings that flow with the lyrics and contain abstract art
Generally music videos can be said to contain visuals that either represent the potential connotative meaning of the lyrics or a semiotic system of its own Although many analysts would explain a music video as a narrative structure there are many videos that defy narrative conventions

Intertextuality
Intertextuality for media purposes references other popular culture objects within their video and then the audience creates their meaning of the video according to the intentional suggestion created with relationships between primary and secondary texts In general terms intertextuality is considered links within a context or medium that bind text to other text (Chandler pp&nbsp;166 2007 ) Many editors and directors use intertextuality in music videos because it combines different cultural codes taken from previous texts that are sensible for many audiences Using intertextuality in music videos allow a viewer to identify with their theoretical framework of knowledge and use it to define their identity This approach can be used to gain popularity for referenced ideas and influence consumers with a persuasive agenda Material Girl by Madonna (entertainer)
Intratextuality
Intratextuality is a term that is derived from intertextuality but is considered combining secondary references for marketing and promotional purposes This type of technique is also called anchorage found by Roland Barthes: anchoring text to a context that changes the intentional meaning An example of this would be the music video Right Now by Van Halen The lyrics of the song Right Now suggest an entirely different meaning than the social empowering messages shown through the music video

Bricolage
Bricolage is also an example of using many different texts within a context for promotional marketing or popularity value Lady Gaga uses cultural bricolage in her music videos by using fashion and previous memorable characteristics of former pop stars Michael Jacksons Leave Me Alone is also a form of bricolage because it is a collage of already popular people and pop culture Artifact (archaeology)
