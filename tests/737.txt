An advance market commitment (AMC) is a binding contract typically offered by a government or other financial entity used to guarantee a viable market for a product once it is successfully developed Generally AMCs are used in circumstances where the cost of developing a new product is too high to be worthwhile for the private sector without a guarantee of a certain quantity of purchases in advance

As such AMCs have been used in the creation of vaccines or other medicine with high upfront development costs As a result of such a commitment the market for vaccines or drugs for neglected diseases would be comparable in size and certainty to the market for medicines for rich countries This would encourage biotech and pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new vaccines to tackle the worldâ€™s most pressing health problems such as pneumonia diarrheal disease HIV/AIDS and malaria in the normal course of their business decisions

An AMC has also been launched for Carbon dioxide removal
AMCs were proposed by Michael Kremer and Rachel Glennerster in 2004 to encourage research

 First AMC announced Feb 2007 
In February 2007 five countries (Canada Italy Norway Russia the United Kingdom) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation committed US$15 billion to launch the first advance market commitment to speed the development and availability of a new vaccine which is expected to save the lives of 7 million children by 2030 The pilot provides 7 to 10 years of funding to support the development of future vaccines against pneumococcal disease Pneumococcal disease is a major cause of pneumonia and meningitis and it kills 16 million people every year The pilot includes provisions to assure the long term sustainable supply and price for the poorest countries

The AMC for pneumococcal disease offers an improved market for vaccines now in development Vaccines are bought only if they meet predetermined standards of efficacy and safety and if developing countries ask for them After 7 to 10 years the AMC funding is likely to be depleted 

An independent expert committee with representation from developing and industrialised countries recommended that pneumococcal disease be the target of the initial AMC pilot Going forward the AMC will be overseen by an independent assessment committee which will set and monitor standards for the vaccines The World Health Organization will facilitate the establishment of the target product profile and assess the quality safety and immunogenicity of AMC vaccines The GAVI Alliance and the World Bank will be responsible for supporting the programmatic and financial functions of the AMC

 Origins of the idea 

The idea of such a contract previously proposed in academic literature by Professor Michael Kremer and editorial
Target Product Profile
The Target Product Profile (TPP) for the Pneumococcal Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) was developed by the World Health Organization at the request of the AMC Secretariat On December 11 2008 the Independent Assessment Committee (IAC) officially endorsed the TPP making it the definitive set of guidelines for determining the characteristics of AMCeligible pneumococcal conjugate vaccines The TPP sets out the standards a vaccine must meet in order to be eligible for sale under the AMC program and the IAC determines whether a candidate vaccine meets the TPP specifications To meet the TPP a vaccine must meet or exceed 13 requirements Specific requirements in the TPP relate to the projected public health impact vaccine safety and suitability of the product for use in developing country health systems
