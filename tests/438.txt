Vaccine efficacy or vaccine effectiveness is the percentage reduction of disease cases in a Treatment group
Vaccine efficacy was designed and calculated by Greenwood and Yule in 1915 for the Cholera vaccine
Vaccine efficacy studies are used to measure several important and critical outcomes of interest such as disease attack rates hospitalizations due to the disease deaths due to the disease asymptomatic infection serious adverse events due to vaccination vaccine reactogenicity and cost effectiveness of the vaccine Vaccine efficacy is calculated on a set Population study
Formula

The outcome data (vaccine efficacy) generally are expressed as a proportionate reduction in disease attack rate (AR) between the unvaccinated (ARU) and vaccinated (ARV) or can be calculated from the relative risk (RR) of disease among the vaccinated group

The basic formula is written as:<math display"block">VE  \frac \times 100\%</math>with
 <math display"inline">VE</math>  Vaccine efficacy
 <math>ARU</math>  Attack rate of unvaccinated people
 <math>ARV</math>  Attack rate of vaccinated people

An alternative equivalent formulation of vaccine efficacy is: <math display"block">VE  (1  RR) \times 100\%</math>where <math>RR</math> is the Risk ratio
The design of Phases of clinical research
Relative risk

First the baseline risk can be calculated for each group and then vaccine efficacy (relative risk reduction <math display“inline”>0196 \%</math> for the vaccinated group (24 infections)
 <math>086 \%</math> for the placebo group (106 infections)
 The relative risk <math>RR \approx 023</math>
Then <math>VE(1RR) \times 100 \implies (1023) \times 100 \approx 77\%</math>

Also the absolute risk reduction (ARR) for any vaccine can simply be obtained from calculating the difference of risks between the groups  ie 086%–0196% which renders a value of about 066% for the above example

Testing
Vaccine efficacy differs from vaccine effectiveness in the same way that an : vaccine efficacy shows how effective a vaccine could be given ideal circumstances and 100% vaccine uptake (such as the conditions within a controlled clinical trial); vaccine effectiveness measures how well a vaccine performs when it is used in routine circumstances in the community What makes vaccine efficacy relevant is that it shows the Attack rate
The advantages of measuring vaccine efficacy is having the ability to control for selection bias as well as prospective active monitoring for disease attack rates and careful tracking of vaccination status for a study population there is normally a subset as well; laboratory confirmation of the infectious outcome of interest and a sampling of vaccine immunogenicity Since 2014 epidemiologists have used quasiexperimental designs to obtain unbiased estimates of vaccine effectiveness

Standardized statements of efficacy may be parametrically expanded to include multiple categories of efficacy in a Table (information)
Cases studied
The New England Journal of Medicine did a study on the efficacy of a vaccine for the influenza A virus A total of 1952 subjects were enrolled and received study vaccines in the fall of 2007 Influenza activity occurred from January through April 2008 with the circulation of influenza types:
 A (Influenza A virus subtype H3N2 Influenza B
Absolute efficacy against both types of influenza as measured by isolating the Viral culture
Since 2004 clinical trials testing the efficacy of the influenza vaccine have been slowly coming in: 2058 people were vaccinated in October and November 2005 Influenza activity was prolonged but of low intensity; type A (H3N2) was the virus that was generally spreading around the population which was very like the vaccine itself The efficacy of the inactivated vaccine was 16% (95% confidence interval CI 171% to 70%) for the virus identification end point (virus isolation in cell culture or identification through polymerase chain reaction) and 54% (95% CI 4%–77%) for the primary end point (virus isolation or increase in Serum (blood)
<!The information in the previous sections dont obviously point to this conclusion at least for the nontechnical readers So providing references for the statements below would probably make them more reliable/believable or maybe explaining how the info in the previous sections leads directly to this is enough>With Serology
