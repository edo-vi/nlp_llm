Scottie Cramp is a disease in Scottish Terriers causing spasms and hyperflexion and hyperextension of the legs  It is caused by a disorder in serotonin metabolism that causes a deficiency of available serotonin  It is inherited as an recessive gene
Scotty Cramp occurs in puppies and young dogs  Symptoms present after exercise or excitement and last a few minutes  A goosestepping gait and arched spine are often seen and the dog may turn somersaults as it runs  The symptoms usually resolve after ten minutes but they may repeat several times in a day Episodes of Scottie Cramp can also be triggered by added stress on the dog  At this time there is known genetic testing available for Scottie Cramp even though this is considered a genetic disease To diagnose Scottie Cramp the veterinarian will perform a physical exam a complete blood count a biochemistry profile and a urinalysis of the dog  If the diagnosis is unsure a dose of methysergide can be given  In affected dogs this will block serotonin and increase the frequency and severity of the symptoms  Because Scotty Cramp is inherited affected dogs and their parents and siblings should not be bred
