Artificial stupidity is a term used within the field of computer science to refer to a technique of "dumbing down" computer programs in order to deliberately introduce errors in their responses

 History 

Alan Turing in his 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence proposed a test for intelligence which has since become known as the Turing test While there are a number of different versions the original test described by Turing as being based on the "imitation game" involved a "machine intelligence" (a computer running an AI program) a female participant and an interrogator Both the AI and the female participant were to claim that they were female and the interrogators task was to work out which was the female participant and which was not by examining the participants responses to typed questions While it is not clear whether or not Turing intended that the interrogator was to know that one of the participants was a computer while discussing some of the possible objections to his argument Turing raised the concern that "machines cannot make mistakes"



As Turing then noted the reply to this is a simple one: the machine should not attempt to "give the right answers to the arithmetic problems" Instead deliberate errors should be introduced to the computers responses

 Applications 

Within computer science there are at least two major applications for artificial stupidity: the generation of deliberate errors in chatbots attempting to pass the Turing test or to otherwise fool a participant into believing that they are human; and the deliberate limitation of computer AIs in video games in order to control the games difficulty

 Chatbots 

The first Loebner prize competition was run in 1991 As reported in The Economist the winning entry incorporated deliberate errors&nbsp;– described by The Economist as "artificial stupidity"&nbsp;– to fool the judges into believing that it was human This technique has remained a part of the subsequent Loebner prize competitions and reflects the issue first raised by Turing

 Game design 

Lars Lidén argues that good game design involves finding a balance between the computers "intelligence" and the players ability to win By finely tuning the level of "artificial stupidity" it is possible to create computer controlled plays that allow the player to win but do so "without looking unintelligent"

Algorithms

There are many ways to deliberately introduce poor decisionmaking in search algorithms Take the minimax algorithm for example The minimax algorithm is an adversarial search algorithm that is popularly used in games that require more than one player to compete against each other The main purpose in this algorithm is to choose a move that maximizes your chance of winning and avoid moves that maximizes the chance of your opponent winning An algorithm like this would be extremely beneficial to the computer as computers are able to search thousands of moves ahead To "dumb down" this algorithm to allow for different difficulty levels heuristic functions have to be tweaked Normally huge points are given in winning states Tweaking the heuristic by reducing such big payoffs would reduce the chance of the algorithm in choosing the winning state

Creating heuristic functions to allow for stupidity is more difficult than one might think If a heuristic allows for the best move the computer opponent would be too omniscient making the game frustrating and unenjoyable But if the heuristic is poor the game might also be unenjoyable Therefore a balance of good moves and bad moves in an adversarial game relies on a wellimplemented heuristic function

 Arguments on artificial stupidity 

A 1993 editorial in The Economist argues that there is "no practical reason" to attempt to create a machine that mimics the behaviour of a human being since the purpose of a computer is to perform tasks that humans cannot accomplish alone or at least not as efficiently Discussing the winning entry in a 1991 Turing contest which was programmed to introduce deliberate typing errors into its conversation to fool the judges the editorial asks: "Who needs a computer that cant type?"
