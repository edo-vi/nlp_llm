The Essendon Football Club supplements saga was a sports controversy that occurred during the early and mid2010s (decade)
The initial stages of the investigation in 2013 made no findings regarding the legality of the supplements program Still they highlighted a wide range of governance and dutyofcare failures relating to the program In August 2013 the AFL fined Essendon $2 million barred the club from the 2013 finals series and suspended senior coach James Hird and general manager Danny Corcoran (sports administrator)
The second phase of the investigation resulted in thirtyfour players being issued show cause notices by ASADA and infraction notices by the AFL in 2014 alleging the use of Thymosin beta4 during the 2012 season After facing an AFL Tribunal hearing in the 2014/15 offseason the players were initially found not guilty The decision was then appealed by WADA to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) which returned a guilty verdict on 12 January 2016 The guilty verdict was unsuccessfully appealed in the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland The thirtyfour players were suspended for two years affecting seventeen stillactive AFL players who missed the 2016 AFL season

The program primarily comprised subcutaneous injections of supplements to improve soft tissue recovery times to enable players to endure and benefit from a heavier training workload The players signed consent forms for the program and were assured that all substances were ASADAapproved The program included injections of lipotropin
In January 2012 Essendons club doctor Bruce Reid (doctor)
In May 2012 in a meeting of club administrators including Reid and Dank Dank was directed to cease giving injections to players; however evidence given by players indicated that the program was reduced rather than ceased with many continuing to receive injections until as late as July

Selfreport and 2013 investigations
On 5 February 2013 Essendon reported itself to the AFL and the Australian Sports AntiDoping Authority (ASADA) over concerns about the program Two days later the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) released a broad report entitled "Organised Crime and Drugs in Sport" the culmination of a twelvemonth investigation which outlined an increase in illegal activities in sport across Australia including drug use matchfixing and links to organised crime; part of the report dealt with an increase in the seizure and use of steroids and illegal supplements and included an anonymous reference to Essendons program The timing of these events led to speculation that the AFL having been privy to a confidential briefing on the ACC report had tipped off Essendon and encouraged the club to selfreport before the report went public but this was never proven and was denied by the AFL Within days Essendon removed banners and murals from the façade at Windy Hill Essendon
Following Essendons selfreporting ASADA and the AFL launched a joint investigation into the supplements program and conducted that investigation over the next sixteen months During the early phase of the investigation much attention and media speculation fell on the antiobesity supplement AOD9604 which had appeared on consent forms and was acknowledged to have been administered in the program including by Essendon captain Jobe Watson during a television interview The legal status of AOD9604 at the time of the program was uncertain: it was not explicitly listed as banned under 
Parallel to the AFLASADA investigation Essendon commissioned former Telstra Chief Executive Officer
At the same time as Essendon was being investigated the CronullaSutherland Sharks club from the National Rugby League was also under investigation for its CronullaSutherland Sharks supplements saga
August 2013 interim report and governance charges
On 2 August 2013 almost seven months into the investigation ASADA released an interim report to the AFL and Essendon Football Club The interim report made no findings regarding the legality of the supplements program but highlighted a wide range of governance and dutyofcare failures related to the program On 13 August 2013 based on the interim report AFL general counsel Andrew Dillon charged Essendon with "conduct that is unbecoming or likely to prejudice the interests or reputation of the Australian Football League or to bring the game of football into disrepute contrary to AFL Rule 16" The charges included:
Having "engaged in practices that exposed players to significant risks to their health and safety as well as the risk of using substances that were prohibited by the AFL AntiDoping Code and the World AntiDoping Code"
Allowing "a culture of frequent uninformed and unregulated use of the injection of supplements" at the club
Had "failed to meaningfully inform players of the substances the subject of the program and obtain their informed consent to the administration of the substances"
Having an incomplete recordkeeping system made it impossible to determine with certainty whether or not players had been administered banned supplements
The bypassing of human resources practices relating specifically to the employment of Robinson and Dank

The interim report found that Essendon had intended the program to be an innovative program of unprecedented scale to deliver a competitive edge to the club but that it had not done adequate research nor established clear lines of accountability for those implementing the program The AFL Tribunal later commented that there was a "deplorable absence of records in the program relating to its administration"

Essendon and the AFL discussed and negotiated penalties for the charges over two days in August On 27 August 2013 five days before the final round of the 2013 homeandaway season the following penalties were agreed to and imposed:
Essendon was fined $2 million an Australian sporting record fine against a club
Essendon was ruled ineligible to compete in the 2013 AFL finals series and would be relegated to finish ninth; (the club was on track to qualify for the finals in seventh place)
Essendon was prohibited from exercising draft picks in two drafts: in 2013 its first and secondround draft picks were prohibited and in 2014 it was prohibited from exercising the first and secondround draft picks it would have received based on its finishing position but was granted the last draft pick in the first round
Senior coach James Hird was suspended from involvement in any football club for twelve months effective 25 August 2013
Football operations manager Danny Corcoran was suspended from involvement in any football club for four months with a further twomonth suspended sentence effective 1 October 2013
A fine of $30000 was imposed on assistant coach Mark Thompson Thompson personally paid $5000 of the fine with Essendon covering the balance

As part of the agreement Hird dropped legal action that he had raised against the charges in the Supreme Court

Club doctor Bruce Reid was also charged and issued a suspension He announced he would contest the charges in the Supreme Court of Victoria and on 18 September 2013 the AFL dropped the charges The leagues official statement concluded: "Reid strongly supports the AFL in its fundamental priority of looking after the health and welfare of players He shares his concern over the serious circumstances which gave rise to the supplements saga at the Essendon Football Club  The AFL accepts Dr Reid’s position and withdraws all charges against him without penalty"

Hird remained on the Essendon payroll and received his full salary during the suspension The AFL initially demanded that the payments stopped when they were made public in December 2013 but acquiesced after determining that its legal position was weak In Hirds absence Mark Thompson stepped up to serve as senior coach in the 2014 season

At the time of the penalties for governance failures no charges were laid against any players whether or not banned substances had been used was unproven and the ASADA and AFL investigation remained open

Charges against players

2014: showcause notices
After sixteen months of investigations ASADA issued show cause notices to 34 players from Essendons 2012 player list on 12 June 2014 alleging that they had been administered Thymosin beta4 having determined that it had sufficient evidence that this was the type of thymosin used in the program Unlike AOD9604 it was certain that Thymosin beta4 was considered banned during the program ASADA did not allege that the players had used the substances intentionally; rather the club had knowingly injected the players with the banned substance and that the players were unaware that it was illegal The players had ten days to respond which would be followed by a tribunal hearing in which the burden of proof fell on ASADA to prove that the banned substance was administered to the players Under the antidoping codes players found guilty would receive as a starting point a twoyear suspension; however if they were able to demonstrate they were unwittingly given a prohibited substance they may have been eligible for a 50 per cent reduction The names of the 34 players were initially suppressed under court order and were formally released only after the eventual guilty verdict in January 2016

While this was progressing Essendon performed well under Mark Thompson during the 2014 season finishing seventh on the ladder and being eliminated in the first week of the finals Thompson left the club altogether after the season

File: Melbourne Federal CourtJPGShortly after the showcause notices were issued Essendon and James Hird challenged the legal validity of the joint investigation that ASADA had conducted with the AFL temporarily putting the notices on hold The club argued that although AFL rules allowed it to compel its players and officials to be interviewed ASADA had no legal right to do the same – and therefore that evidence collected by the AFL in a compulsory interview was inadmissible for an ASADA investigation The case came before the Melbourne division of the Federal Court of Australia on 27 June 2014; and on 19 September 2014 Justice John Middleton of the Federal Court dismissed the challenge and found investigation to be lawful In the decision he ruled that ASADA had actively used the AFLs power to compel interviews to overcome its own inability to do likewise; but that this was within the rule of law and with the Essendon players knowledge because all interviews were knowingly held in the presence of an ASADA representative

On 1 October 2014 Essendon announced that it would not appeal the ruling stating that to do so would act against the interests of the players Hird however acting in an individual capacity and "on a matter of principle" appealed the ruling to a full bench of the Federal Court Media commentators speculated that Hirds action would result in his termination as Essendon coach and Hird himself later testified in court that he had been advised as much Hird returned to court in early November 2014 and his appeal was dismissed on 29 January 2015 Hird considered a High Court of Australia
2014–2015: AFL Tribunal hearing against players
After Essendons Federal Court challenge was dismissed in October 2014 (but while Hirds was still ongoing) ASADA issued fresh showcause notices to the players on 17 October 2014 The players had two weeks to respond to the notices and exercised their right not to respond On 13 November 2014 the AntiDoping Rule Violation Panel concluded that sufficient evidence existed against the players and they were placed on the register of findings The following day the AFL issued infraction notices to the players The players faced a closed hearing of the AFL Tribunal over several sessions between December 2014 and February 2015 The Legal burden of proof
Upon issuing of the infractions notices on 14 November players could accept provisional suspensions meaning they would be ineligible to play AFLsanctioned matches until the Tribunal hearing was finalised but that they could continue to train in the preseason and that time served during the provisional suspension would be counted as part of any final suspension Most players accepted the provisional suspensions immediately; Dustin Fletcher and Jobe Watson both participated in the 2014 International Rules Series test match on 22 November before beginning their suspensions; Alwyn Davey and Leroy Jetta neither of whom was on the Essendon list any longer both opted to play the 2014/15 Northern Territory Football League season (which runs over the Australian summer) and did not begin their provisional suspensions until February 2015

After the tribunal hearings were complete it was announced that a final decision was expected in late March This meant that the thirtyfour players including seventeen still at Essendon would be under provisional suspension during the 2015 NAB Challenge preseason matches All twentyfive Essendon players who were at the club during the supplements program received permission to miss the series including eight players who were not facing charges but were permitted to stand aside to protect their teammates anonymity; of those eight players four elected to play Essendon was given permission to field Victorian Football League
On 31 March the week before the opening of the 2015 AFL season the tribunal announced that it had found the 34 players not guilty The tribunal confirmed that Thymosin beta4 was a banned substance during the program but that it was not comfortably satisfied that the players had been administered the substance The threemember tribunal was unanimous in its decision The tribunal repeated prior criticisms of the governance of the Essendons supplements program which had been seen in the ASADA interim report and the Switkowski report

As a result of the verdict the provisional suspensions on the players were lifted and all affected players were eligible to play in Round 1 ASADA and the AFL were given a window of 21 days to appeal the decision The verdict was handed down in private and few other details about the reasons for the decision were released

2015 season and WADA appeal
On 20 April 2015 ASADA announced that it would not appeal the AFL AntiDoping Tribunals notguilty verdicts ASADAs decision then allowed the World AntiDoping Agency (WADA) to initiate its own review and appeal In the process of lodging its appeal the CAS erroneously made public on its website the names of the players; the names were promptly removed but the players anonymity was for the first time compromised

Onfield Essendons form deteriorated dramatically in 2015 attributed in part to the mental impact of the WADA appeal The club held a 3–3 record before WADA announced its appeal before finishing 15th with a record of 6–16 Hird resigned as coach with three weeks remaining in the season Chairman Paul Little (Australian businessman)
CAS began to hear WADAs appeal on 16 November 2015 in Sydney CASs panel of arbitrators comprised England
2016: Court of Arbitration for Sport verdict
On 12 January 2016 CAS handed down a guilty verdict on the thirtyfour Essendon players overturning the AFL AntiDoping Tribunals notguilty verdict after finding it was comfortably satisfied that the players were injected with Thymosin beta4

Vital to the case was determining whether or not the unspecified Thymosin used in the program was the banned Thymosin Beta4 or a different legal variety of Thymosin A paper trail had confirmed that Dank had been dispensed Thymosin Beta4 by the Como Compounding Pharmacy; however no direct evidence was found that it was this Thymosin rather than a different legal Thymosin which had been administered to players and this missing evidence link had been key to the AFL Tribunals not guilty verdict under the links in the chain method Part of the WADA submission to the appeal which the CAS accepted in its verdict was that Thymosin Beta4 was the only form of Thymosin which would have had the soft tissue recovery effect that Dank had attributed to it – text messages from Dank had specifically described Thymosin as the cornerstone of the soft tissue recovery program Two urine samples taken from Essendon players during 2012 were also found to contain elevated Thymosin Beta4; the levels were not high enough to fail the drug test but they added to the cable of evidence against the players

Significantly the CAS also determined that the players were "significantly at fault" disqualifying them from any penalty reduction This was considered a surprise as press throughout the entire saga had opined that by having followed the direction of club officials the players would be found to have had no significant fault or negligence qualifying them for a 50% penalty reduction Consequently the players were handed the full minimum suspensions of two years – these were backdated to 31 March 2015 which was the date of the original AFL Tribunal not guilty verdict; and with credit taken for the periods of provisional suspension already served during the 2014/15 offseason resulted in most of the suspensions running until November 2016

2016: Federal Supreme Court appeal
Following the CAS finding the sole remaining avenue for appeal was the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland under whose jurisdiction the CAS sits An appeal was lodged on 10 February arguing that the CAS did not have legal grounds to conduct a de novo hearing and could have appealed the AFL Tribunals verdict only based on legal error or gross unreasonableness

During the year both parties submitted paperwork in German language


The players did not seek an injunction against their suspensions when appealing with the Federal Supreme Court meaning that they would have served their 2016 suspensions even if the guilty verdicts had been cleared

Penalties
Following the CASs guilty verdict on 12 January 2016 all affected players were formally named and began their suspensions immediately The twoyear ineligibility period was backdated to 31 March 2015 and credit was taken for provisional suspensions served during the 2014/15 offseason This meant that most players were suspended until November 2016

Under the terms of the ban players were not permitted to:
Play Australian rules football at any level;
Enter the club premises or clubrooms on game day;
Train under the direction of a clubdevised program; or
Return to their clubs training sessions until two months before their bans expired

Because of these limitations the bans also covered most forms of coaching As such two former players (Mark McVeigh and Henry Slattery) who were employed as nonplaying coaches were suspended from their jobs and players serving as playing coaches in country leagues were suspended from performing either function The bans extended to any sport administered by a signatory to the WADA code precluding active involvement in almost any organised sport during 2016

Players were not completely banned from involvement with the AFL and were permitted to:
Attend AFL matches including those involving Essendon as spectators;
Continue to communicate with their teammates and coaches on a social level;
Train away from the club with other banned players except in a clubdevised program and;
Work in the media at AFL games

The thirtyfour players suspended are listed in the below table grouped by their status at the time of the CAS verdict<! Note to editors: Please do not edit the table below according to their playing statuses as of 2022 This table is their playing statuses at the time of the penalties being handed out>

! Status !! Number 
On 15 November 2016 after the final avenue for appeal had been exhausted with the Federal Supreme Court the AFL Commission reviewed the 2012 Brownlow Medal which had been won by Jobe Watson as the fairest and best player in the league during the season in which the supplements program was in effect The rules governing the Brownlow Medal make a player ineligible to win in a season in which he is suspended; and the commission ruled that Watsons doping suspensions rendered him retrospectively ineligible under that rule Watson was stripped of the medal and it was awarded jointly to the players who polled the secondmost votes: Trent Cotchin () and Sam Mitchell (footballer)
2016 AFL season
The CAS verdict meant that Essendons squad was suddenly twelve players short for the 2016 season The club received permission to recruit ten topup players from lower levels on contracts lasting until 31 October 2016 to supplement its list The topups had to have either been on an AFL list in 2014 or 2015 with no more than one player taken from any single statelevel club; or have been a Victorian Football League
The twelve suspended players still at Essendon continued to be paid about 95% of their salaries by the club during their suspensions Stewart Crameri continued to be paid by the Western Bulldogs with the Bulldogs suing Essendon to recover the cost Melbourne Port Adelaide and St Kilda ceased payments to their suspended players those players suing Essendon privately for their salaries By September 2017 the club had reached outofcourt compensation deals with all players covering potential and actual loss of earnings and mental anguish; the sizes of the deals were confidential but the largest payouts were understood to have gone to Jobe Watson who was stripped of the Brownlow Medal and Stewart Crameri who missed the Western Bulldogs 2016 AFL Grand Final
Despite the topup players the weakened Essendon team was mostly uncompetitive during 2016 finishing last on the ladder with just three wins to win the wooden spoon (award)
Ten of the twelve suspended players resigned with Essendon for 2017; the two who departed were Michael Hibberd who was traded to  and Tayte Pears who retired There was speculation that the players could have left the club en masse with lawyers arguing that Essendons role in the scandal could have been considered a breach of contract allowing the players to get out of their playing contracts and bypass other AFL player movement restrictions to qualify as delisted free agents but no players sought this option Of the ten topup players only two (James Kelly and Matt Dea) remained with the club beyond the 2016 season: Kelly played one further season before retiring and Dea played two more seasons before being delisted

Case against Stephen Dank
The AFL Tribunal heard cases against sports scientist Stephen Dank during the summer of 2014/15 and he was found guilty of ten charges The charges upheld against Dank covered a wide range of illegal supplements that he trafficked in attempted to traffic in or was complicit in attempted trafficking when the AFL registered him The upheld charges were:
Attempted trafficking and complicity in attempted trafficking in Thymosin Beta4 Hexarelin and Humanofort to Essendon in 2012
Trafficking in Mechano Growth Factor to a support staff member of the Carlton Football Club in 2012
Attempted trafficking and complicity in attempted trafficking in CJC1295 to the Gold Coast Football Club in 2010
Trafficking in GHRP6 and complicity in attempted trafficking in Hexarelin SARMS CJC1295 and GHRP6 to a baseball club in 2012
Trafficking in GHRP6 and Mechano Growth Factor to the Medical Rejuvenation Clinic in 2011–2012
The AFL suspended Dank from involvement in the sport for life Since most Australian sporting organisations honour sanctions imposed by other leagues this effectively blackballed Dank from major Australian sport Dank was found not guilty of twentyone other charges including trafficking charges and all charges related to administering the supplements Dank appealed the ten guilty verdicts but the appeals were dismissed after he failed to attend his session with the AFL appeals board in November 2016 WADA lodged an appeal against the twentyone not guilty verdicts in June 2015

Other consequences
Dean Robinson who was sacked by the club in February 2013 when it selfreported the program brought an unfair dismissal case against the club which was settled in October 2014 for a $1&nbsp;million payout

Most of the clubs expenses related to the scandal including legal bills and the payout to Robinson were covered by Essendons insurers Chubb Limited Hird however was left with a large personal legal bill because the insurance policy for administrative staff covered only the defence of a legal action not initiating a legal action against others Hird unsuccessfully sued Chubb for approximately $660000 in costs in his 2014 court challenges of legality of the AFL/ASADA joint investigation but it was later revealed that a benefactor who was not publicly identified stepped in to cover the costs Hirds total legal costs from the saga including covering ASADAs costs in his failed cases against it totalled $174&nbsp;million

Former player Hal Hunter who was on the rookie list during the program but was not among the thirtyfour players suspended sued the club to obtain full documentation about what substances he was administered at the club After a yearlong legal battle the Supreme Court ruled in early 2016 that Essendon had already provided Hunter with all documentation it had; Hunter was initially ordered to cover Essendons legal costs for the lawsuit but that was reversed after mediation Similarly to the other 34 players Hunter received a compensation package from Essendon for involving him in the program

Following adverse findings of the program WorkSafe Victoria performed an investigation In November 2015 it convicted Essendon of two breaches of the states Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to provide the players with a workplace free of health risks The club was fined $200000 for the breaches

The handling of the investigation and prosecution by both the AFL and ASADA was criticised by some media personnel and other public figures There were suggestions that a parliamentary inquiry should be held into the saga but this was ruled out by Greg Hunt Minister for Sport (Australia)
