Danny Almonte Rojas (born April 7 1987) is a DominicanAmerican former baseball player who is currently an assistant baseball coach at Cardinal Hayes High School in New York City Born in Moca Dominican Republic
Little League Baseball
In 2000 Danny Almonte moved to The Bronx New York City where he began playing Little League Baseball His father Felipe who had moved to the US six years earlier had begun a youth baseball league in Moca Dominican Republic
2001 Little League World Series

Almonte threw a nohitter in the 2001 MidAtlantic Regional finals against State College Pennsylvania
In a roundrobin tournament
Almonte completed the tournament with 62 strikeouts (out of 72 batters faced) giving up only three hits in three starts and only one unearned run His team nicknamed "the Baby Bombers" because they played in the shadow of Yankee Stadium (1923)
Concerns about age
Almontes imposing appearance and command on the mound as well as the velocity of his fastball led to rumors that he was older than 12 years old the age limit for Little League Baseball A team from Staten Island hired a private investigator to look into the ages of the entire team A similar investigation was conducted by a team from Pequannock Township New Jersey
Reporters from Sports Illustrated went to the civil records building in Moca two weeks after the end of the 2001 Series They discovered a notation in the birth ledger showing that in 1994 Felipe Almonte had registered his sons birth date as April 7 1987 at Dr Toribio Bencosme Hospital—which would have made him 14 years old at the time of the 2001 Series It was common for Dominican parents to wait years before registering the birth of a child Their report posted on the magazines website just before being published triggered a full investigation by Little League even as Almonte and his teammates were being feted in the Bronx Almontes mother Sonia Rojas Breton owned a handwritten birth certificate saying that he had been born at home in Jamao al Norte
Both of Almontes parents though marital separation
Age disclosure
As part of Dominican officials investigation Victor Romero head of the national public records office interviewed the witnesses whose signatures appeared on the 1989 birth certificate They both denied knowing Dannys parents let alone signing the certificate On August 31 Romero announced that Danny had been born in 1987

As a result Danny Almonte was retroactively declared ineligible and the Baby Bombers had to forfeit all their wins in tournament play All of their records were removed from the books and the team was required to demonstrate compliance with all regulations before entering the 2002 tournament Felipe was banned from Little League competition for life Paulino was also banned since Little League rules make the league president responsible for player eligibility Dominican prosecutors filed criminal charges against Felipe for falsifying a birth certificate Danny who did not speak English language
About the same time New York City child welfare officials discovered that Danny had not been enrolled in school for the 2000–01 year—which would be a violation of state law and grounds for placing him in foster care Dannys registration listed him as attending Public School 70 in the Bronx However Dominican school officials said they had records that Danny had actually attended school in the Dominican Republic until June 15 This would have made him ineligible for the Little League World Series even if he had actually been 12 years old Little League rules require a player to have appeared in at least half of his teams games by June 15 in order to be eligible for the allstar team that competes in the tournament Danny then enrolled at Public School 52 in the Bronx in September
