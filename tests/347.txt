The biological terrain assessment or BTA is a set of tests used to measure the pH resistivity and redox of a persons urine blood and saliva It is often associated with homeopathy and Holistic Health__TOC__
 Usefulness 

Proponents of the BTA claim that comparing the pH resistivity and redox of the blood urine and saliva provides a health practitioner an indication of the metabolic processes taking place inside the body There is no scientific evidence that these measurements provide a medically relevant indication of metabolic processes Multiple manufacturers of BTA equipment have been prevented from selling their equipment in the United States because they lack Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval However the FDA has not stated whether the BTA is medically useful or not

The Quantitative Fluid Analyzer (QFA) manufactured by Health Science Company does have FDA classification as a "laboratory instrument for medical purposes" "ion selective" Class 1 510(K) exempt However it does not have CLIA (Clinical Laboratory improvement Amendment 1988) waiver
