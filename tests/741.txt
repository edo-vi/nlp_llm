An epilogue or epilog (from Ancient Greek
Epilogues are usually set in the future after the main story is completed Within some genres it can be used to hint at the next installment in a series of work It is also used to satisfy the readers curiosity and to cover any loose ends of the story File:Transcript of Epiloguejpg
 History of the term 
The first known use of the word epilogue was in the 15th century and it was used as a concluding section for literary work

In Middle English and Middle French the term "epilogue" was used In Latin they used epilogus from Greek epilogos and then epilegein

The first citation of the word epilogue in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1564: "Now at length you are come to the Epilogue (as it were) or full conclusion of your worke" Prior to this the OED only refers to Caxtons term ‘Epylogacion’ in 1474 ‘The Epylogacion and recapitulation of this book’ However this term was not widely followed and instead ‘conclusion’ was the term used to introduce final words of a text The first example of a dramatic epilogue in print is John Phillips The Play of Patient and Meek Grissell (1569) Although in nondramatic publications the word does appear prior to this such as in Turberviles Epitaphs (1566)

The word epilogue could be adopted to describe the end of speeches within medieval plays but at the time this was primarily used to hint at the connection to later works Most Greek plays would end with lines from the Chorus which was different to the epilogues of early modern playwrights as well as Ancient Roman plays

American Author Henry James has said the epilogue is a place that distributes last "prizes pensions husbands wives babies millions appended paragraphs and cheerful remarks" The word epilogue has also been described as a "Parthian Dart" by Pat Rogers He said it has the potential to be excessive for some readers as it has a "shift in tense and a jump in tempoan accelerando" which quickly changes to a "loosening of the temporal screw enabling us to move rapidly ahead over a period of years" Epilogues also consisted of traditional "topoi" which was a metaphor introduced by Aristotle to symbolise writers creating arguments in their story

An epilogue is the final chapter (books)
An epilogue can continue in the same narrative style and perspective as the preceding story although the form of an epilogue can occasionally be drastically different from the overall story It can also be used as a sequel

 Books 
For example in Margaret Atwoods The Handmaids Tale the epilogue is a transcript of a symposium at a university in the Arctic held in 2195 The majority of the epilogue is a speech given by a professor named Pieixoto who is an expert on the area of Gilead where The Handmaids Tale takes place In the epilogue the land of Gilead has long gone and the main character Offred has her story published The story is her perspective of the past events within the novel and Offred titles her publication the eponym ‘The Handmaids Tale’

In George Orwells Animal Farm the epilogue is used to satisfy the curiosity of the readers by revealing a utopic ending to the characters in the Manor Farm many years after the revolution "YEARS passed The seasons came and went the short animal lives fled by A time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before the Rebellion except Clover Benjamin Moses the raven and a number of the pigs"

 Horror and suspense novels 
The epilogue can be used to reveal an approaching threat for the character Readers may believe that the villain has been dealt with but the epilogue will suggest that this is not entirely true adding to the horror and mystery of the story

 Childrens fantasy 
In childrens fantasy it has a particular purpose It can serve as a reassuring ending to calm fears about a possible bad outcome This is seen in the Harry Potter Saga where the characters have a happy ending as they are much older and with families This provides comfort for readers who may have anticipated a bad outcome for them Epilogues also serve as a transitory stage for the novel to change genres into myths and Legend (disambiguation)
 Plays 
In Greek and Elizabethan plays an actor would stand at the front of the stage and speak directly to the audience They would usually show the contentment the characters have after experiencing the tragedies within the play If the hero has had a tragic ending the speaker of the epilogue would provide the moral lesson that the audience can learn from after the heros poor moral choices were made

 Elizabethan plays 
For example in Shakespeares sonnets
<div style"textalign: center;"> "A glooming peace this morning with it brings;

The sun for sorrow will not show his head

Go hence to have more talk of these sad things

Some shall be pardoned and some punished

For never was a story of more woe

Than this of Juliet and her Romeo" </div>

In As You Like It the epilogue is said by Rosalind which shows her content

"… and I charge you O men for the love you bear to women—as I perceive by your simpering none of you hates them—that between you and the women the play may please If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me complexions that liked me and breaths that I defied not And I am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when I make curtsy bid me farewell"

Epilogues were more frequently delivered by actors As the epilogue would frame the end of the play it would allow the speaker to both simultaneously perform and reflect on the character In combining both the speakers persona and character Felicity Nussbaum called this the "double consciousness" This invites the audience to reflect on each moment and its meaning behind it Within tragedies the female epilogues were the most popular and it would often challenge the integrity of the play For example Tyrannick Love took the main female character who had often undergone tragedy and reconceptualised her to be a comedian in the epilogue The female character was adorned in the same costumes that she wore in Act 5 and the speaker would combine her two entities the tragic role within the main play and her humourized public persona when speaking in the epilogue

Many writers would contribute their epilogues to other writers plays This would often be out of friendship Other epilogues were designated as "written by a person of quality" or "sent from and unknown hand" From the period between 1660 and 1714 outsiders of England would supply both prologues and epilogues 229 times

Epilogues would often focus to ensure the audience will return by pointing out the plays worth in the closing lines There have also been linkages between epilogues and prayers and how they are often synonymous with each other when concluding pieces of literature

 Greek plays 
Most Greek plays would end with lines said by the Chorus (musical theatre)
 Roman plays 
Roman plays have particularly shorter epilogues and mainly consist of pleas for a wikt:plaudite
 The role of gender 
Both prologues and epilogues would typically give women Agency (philosophy)
Gayle Rubins "The Traffic in Women" and Laura Mulveys "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" have sparked critical interest in crosscultural feminism and has increased female audiences in attending theatre David Roberts pioneering The Ladies: Female Patronage of Restoration Drama (1989) argues that the theatres were hostile to female spectators and that prologues and epilogues have contributed to that environment

Michael Gavin argues the opposite and has stated that players direct addresses to women have indicated the value of female audiences which occurred more frequently when the players were female It happened to also be one of the first times the women interacted with each in other in a public forum

Jean Marsden has found that few plays also focus on female sexuality Epilogues spoken by women to women provide stimulating material They would often encourage female fantasy and critique male sexual performance This womantowoman paratext allows females speakers and audiences to be perpetuating sexuality which would not often be spoken of within the main structure of the play

Between 1660 and 1714 a total of 115 prologues and epilogues would feature actors either addressing female audiences or stating facts about the sex One epilogue written by RBoyle to Mr Anthony  claim that poets try but fail to craft male characters that women find attractive Epilogues often raise the topic of virtue but when addressing female audiences they would typically praise the plays lack of virtue to make it a selling point For example the epilogue to Ravenscrofts The Citizen Turn’d Gentleman (1672) tries to appeal to women by demoting virtue as the speaker says to win the ladies favour Ravenscroft will become "the greatest debauchee" The epilogue to Thomas Wrights 1693 comedy The Female Vertuoso Susannah Mountfort sneers that older ladies "boast of Virtue ‘cause unfit for Vice"

Some late Restoration epilogues claim that English women in comparison to women from other countries possess more liberties are better behaved and enjoy happier lives Examples include Francis Mannings All for the Better (1702) epilogue which states that English women have superior breeding over women from Madrid Anne Bracegirdles epilogue to Shadwells The Amorous Bigotte (1690) claims that even though Spanish women may be wiser English women are happier because they are not afraid that their husbands will find out about their lovers

 In opera 
Because commenting on past action is inherently undramatic few operas have epilogues even those with prologues Among those explicitly called epilogues are the concluding scenes of Stravinskys The Rakes Progress and Jacques Offenbach
In film
In films the final scenes may feature a montage of images or clips with a short explanation of what happens to the characters A few examples of such films are 9 to 5 (film)
The epilogue of La La Land (film)
In many documentaries and biopics the epilogue is textbased explaining what happened to the subjects after the events covered in the film

In video games
In video games epilogues can occur at the end of the story usually after the Credit (creative arts)
In video games that allow the Permadeath
A visual novel can also feature a type of epilogue which will wrap up all of the scenarios encountered by a player most often after the game has been fully completed by reaching all of the multiple endings; as is the case with Tsukihime featuring an epilogue that expands on the endings of all completable routes as well as providing context for the rest of the game by explaining events in the prologue
