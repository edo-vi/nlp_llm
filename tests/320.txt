Controversies
On 17 March 2021 night local time BWF stated that all Indonesian players competing in the tournament including all three who had won in the first round were withdrawn from the tournament after 20 of 24 people from the team were contacted by the NHS Test and Trace service via email and were required to enter 10day isolation They were contacted by the National Health Service (England)
This sparked controversy between Indonesian players and the BWF The Indonesians protested because 3 Indian players who are tested positive before the tournament though 24 hours later tested negative after self testing were allowed to play on the tournament while all of Indonesian team members had tested negative for the virus The start of the tournament itself had been delayed for five hours after 7 of COVID19 results were deemed inconclusive The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) also stated that Turkish badminton player Neslihan Yiğit and her trainer who were on the same flight with the Indonesian team from Istanbul to Birmingham but Yiğit was allowed to continue her tournament On 18 March noon local time Yiğit was announced to had also been withdrawn from the tournament by the BWF

Earlier the first round of the mens doubles between Indonesians Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan and English pair Ben Lane and Sean Vendy sparked backlashes because of an arrangement where the service judge on duty Alan Crow was also English However according to the rules BWF never explicitly prohibits a technical official to officiate a match involving athletes from the same country with the technical official against athletes from another country

Indonesian National Olympic Committee also alleged unprofessional and discriminatory treatment by BWF as Indonesian team are not allowed to use lifts and take the bus by the organizers On 22 March the president of BWF PoulErik Høyer Larsen officially apologizes to Indonesian Youth and Sports Minister for the circumstances faced by Indonesian team during the event
