The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence was a 1956 summer workshop widely considered to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field

The project lasted approximately six to eight weeks and was essentially an extended brainstorming session Eleven mathematicians and scientists originally planned to attend; not all of them attended but more than ten others came for short times

 Background 

In the early 1950s there were various names for the field of "thinking machines": cybernetics automata theory and complex information processing The variety of names suggests the variety of conceptual orientations

In 1955 John McCarthy (computer scientist)
In early 1955 McCarthy approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funding for a summer seminar at Dartmouth for about 10 participants In June he and Claude Shannon a founder of information theory then at Bell Labs met with Robert Morison Director of Biological and Medical Research to discuss the idea and possible funding though Morison was unsure whether money would be made available for such a visionary project

On September 2 1955 the project was formally proposed by John McCarthy (computer scientist)
The Proposal states:

The proposal goes on to discuss computers natural language processing neural networks theory of computation abstraction and creativity (these areas within the field of artificial intelligence are considered still relevant to the work of the field)

On May 26 1956 McCarthy notified Robert Morison of the planned 11 attendees:

For the full period:
: 1) Marvin Minsky: 2) Julian Bigelow: 3) Donald MacCrimmon MacKay: 4) Ray Solomonoff: 5) John Henry Holland: 6) John McCarthy (computer scientist)
For four weeks:
: 7) Claude Shannon: 8) Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist): 9) Oliver Selfridge
For the first two weeks:
: 10) Allen Newell: 11) Herbert A Simon
He noted "we will concentrate on a problem of devising a way of Computer programming
The actual participants came at different times mostly for much shorter times Trenchard More replaced Rochester for three weeks and MacKay and Holland did not attend—but the project was set to begin 
 
Around June 18 1956 the earliest participants (perhaps only Ray Solomonoff maybe with Tom Etter) arrived at the Dartmouth campus in Hanover NH to join John McCarthy who already had an apartment there Solomonoff and Minsky stayed at Professors apartments but most would stay at the Hanover Inn

 Dates 

The Dartmouth Workshop is said to have run for six weeks in the summer of 1956 Ray Solomonoffs notes written during the Workshop however say it ran for roughly eight weeks from about June 18 to August 17 Solomonoffs Dartmouth notes start on June 22; June 28 mentions Minsky June 30 mentions Hanover NH July 1 mentions Tom Etter On August 17 Solomonoff gave a final talk

 Participants 

Initially McCarthy lost his list of attendees Instead after the workshop McCarthy sent Solomonoff a preliminary list of participants and visitors plus those interested in the subject There were 47 people listed

Solomonoff however made a complete list in his notes of the summer project:

 Ray Solomonoff
 Marvin Minsky
 John McCarthy (computer scientist) Claude Shannon
 Trenchard More
 Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist) Oliver Selfridge
 Julian Bigelow
 W Ross Ashby
 WS McCulloch
 Abraham Robinson
 Tom Etter
 John Forbes Nash Jr David Sayre
 Arthur Samuel (computer scientist) Kenneth R Shoulders
 Shoulders friend
 Alex Bernstein
 Herbert A Simon Allen Newell 

Shannon attended Solomonoffs talk on July 10 and Bigelow gave a talk on August 15 Solomonoff doesnt mention Bernard Widrow but apparently he visited along with WA Clark and BG Farley 

Ray Solomonoff Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy were the only three who stayed for the fulltime Trenchard took attendance during two weeks of his threeweek visit From three to about eight people would attend the daily sessions

 Event and aftermath 

They had the entire top floor of the Dartmouth Math Department to themselves and most weekdays they would meet at the main math classroom where someone might lead a discussion focusing on his ideas or more frequently a general discussion would be held

It was not a directed group research project; discussions covered many topics but several directions are considered to have been initiated or encouraged by the Workshop: the rise of symbolic methods  systems focused on limited domains (early Expert system
Ray Solomonoff kept notes giving his impression of the talks and the ideas from various discussions
