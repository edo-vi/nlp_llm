Space is a Threedimensional space
Debates concerning the nature essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely to treatises like the Timaeus (dialogue)
In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are NonEuclidean geometry
 Philosophy of space 

 Galileo 
Galileo Galilei
As one of the pioneers of modern science Galileo revised the established Aristotelianism
 René Descartes 
René Descartes
The Cartesian notion of space is closely linked to his theories about the nature of the body mind and matter He is famously known for his "cogito ergo sum" (I think therefore I am) or the idea that we can only be certain of the fact that we can doubt and therefore think and therefore exist His theories belong to the Rationalism
 Leibniz and Newton 
File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bernhard Christoph FranckejpgFollowing Galileo and Descartes during the seventeenth century the philosophy of space and time revolved around the ideas of Gottfried Leibniz a German philosopher–mathematician and Isaac Newton who set out two opposing theories of what space is Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter Leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: "space is that which results from places taken together" Unoccupied regions are those that could have objects in them and thus spatial relations with other places For Leibniz then space was an idealised abstraction from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be continuous probability distributionSpace could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members Although people in the family are related to one another the relations do not exist independently of the people
Leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe But since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then according to the identity of indiscernibles there would be no real difference between them According to the principle of sufficient reason any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong

 Kant

 Gauss and Poincaré

Although there was a prevailing Kantian consensus at the time once nonEuclidean geometries had been formalised some began to wonder whether or not physical space is curved Carl Friedrich Gauss a German mathematician was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometrical structure of space He thought of making a test of the sum of the angles of an enormous stellar triangle and there are reports that he actually carried out a test on a small scale by triangulation
Henri Poincaré a French mathematician and physicist of the late 19th century introduced an important insight in which he attempted to demonstrate the futility of any attempt to discover which geometry applies to space by experiment He considered the predicament that would face scientists if they were confined to the surface of an imaginary large sphere with particular properties known as a sphereworld In this world the temperature is taken to vary in such a way that all objects expand and contract in similar proportions in different places on the sphere With a suitable falloff in temperature if the scientists try to use measuring rods to determine the sum of the angles in a triangle they can be deceived into thinking that they inhabit a plane rather than a spherical surface In fact the scientists cannot in principle determine whether they inhabit a plane or sphere and Poincaré argued the same is true for the debate over whether real space is Euclidean or not For him which geometry was used to describe space was a matter of Conventionalism
 Einstein 
Image:Albert Einstein HeadjpgIn 1905 Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity which led to the concept that space and time can be viewed as a single construct known as spacetime In this theory the speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers—which has relativity of simultaneity
Subsequently Einstein worked on a general theory of relativity which is a theory of how gravity interacts with spacetime Instead of viewing gravity as a Force field (physics)
 Mathematics 


In modern mathematics Mathematical space
 Physics 


Space is one of the few fundamental quantity
Today our threedimensional space is viewed as embedded in a fourdimensional spacetime called Minkowski space (see special relativity) The idea behind spacetime is that time is hyperbolicorthogonal to each of the three spatial dimensions

 Relativity 


Before Albert Einsteins work on relativistic physics time and space were viewed as independent dimensions Einsteins discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object–spacetime It turns out that distances in SpacetimeSpacelike interval
In addition time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent in Minkowski space One can freely move in space but not in time Thus time and space coordinates are treated differently both in special relativity (where time is sometimes considered an imaginary number
Furthermore in Einsteins general theory of relativity it is postulated that spacetime is geometrically distorted – curved – near to gravitationally significant masses

One consequence of this postulate which follows from the equations of general relativity is the prediction of moving ripples of spacetime called gravitational waves While indirect evidence for these waves has been found (in the motions of the Hulse–Taylor binary system for example) experiments attempting to directly measure these waves are ongoing at the LIGO and Virgo interferometer</ref>

 Cosmology 


Relativity theory leads to the cosmologycite web

</ref> and has been expanding ever since The overall shape of space is not known but space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the Inflation (cosmology)
 Spatial measurement 


The measurement of physical space has long been important Although earlier societies had developed measuring systems the SI
Currently the standard space interval called a standard meter or simply meter is defined as the speed of light
 Geographical space 


Geography is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing places on Earth utilizing spatial awareness to try to understand why things exist in specific locations Cartography is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation for visualization purposes and to act as a locational device Geostatistics apply statistical concepts to collected spatial data of Earth to create an estimate for unobserved phenomena

Geographical space is often considered as land and can have a relation to ownership usage (in which space is seen as property or territory) While some cultures assert the rights of the individual in terms of ownership other cultures will identify with a communal approach to land ownership while still other cultures such as Australian Aboriginals rather than asserting ownership rights to land invert the relationship and consider that they are in fact owned by the land Spatial planning is a method of regulating the use of space at landlevel with decisions made at regional national and international levels Space can also impact on human and cultural behavior being an important factor in architecture where it will impact on the design of buildings and structures and on farming

Ownership of space is not restricted to land Ownership of airspace and of International waters
Public space is a term used to define areas of land as collectively owned by the community and managed in their name by delegated bodies; such spaces are open to all while private property is the land culturally owned by an individual or company for their own use and pleasure

Abstract space is a term used in geography to refer to a hypothetical space characterized by complete homogeneity When modeling activity or behavior it is a conceptual tool used to limit extraneous variables such as terrain

 In psychology 

Psychologists first began to study the way space is perceived in the middle of the 19th century Those now concerned with such studies regard it as a distinct branch of psychology Psychologists analyzing the perception of space are concerned with how recognition of an objects physical appearance or its interactions are perceived see for example visual space

Other more specialized topics studied include amodal perception and object permanence The perception of surroundings is important due to its necessary relevance to survival especially with regards to hunting and self preservation as well as simply ones idea of personal space

Several spacerelated phobias have been identified including agoraphobia (the fear of open spaces) wikt:astrophobia
The understanding of threedimensional space in humans is thought to be learned during infancy using visual perceptionUnconscious inference
 In the social sciences 
Space has been studied in the social sciences from the perspectives of Marxism feminism postmodernism postcolonialism urban theory and critical geography These theories account for the effect of the history of colonialism transatlantic slavery and globalization on our understanding and experience of space and place The topic has garnered attention since the 1980s after the publication of Henri Lefebvres The Production of Space  In this book Lefebvre applies Marxist ideas about the production of commodities and accumulation of capital to discuss space as a social product His focus is on the multiple and overlapping social processes that produce space

In his book The Condition of Postmodernity David Harvey describes what he terms the "timespace compression" This is the effect of technological advances and capitalism on our perception of time space and distance Changes in the modes of production and consumption of capital affect and are affected by developments in transportation and technology These advances create relationships across time and space new markets and groups of wealthy elites in urban centers all of which annihilate distances and affect our perception of linearity and distance

In his book Thirdspace Edward Soja describes space and spatiality as an integral and neglected aspect of what he calls the "trialectics of being" the three modes that determine how we inhabit experience and understand the world He argues that critical theories in the Humanities and Social Sciences study the historical and social dimensions of our lived experience neglecting the spatial dimension He builds on Henri Lefebvres work to address the dualistic way in which humans understand space—as either material/physical or as represented/imagined Lefebvres "lived space" and Sojas "thirdspace" are terms that account for the complex ways in which humans understand and navigate place which "firstspace" and "Secondspace" (Sojas terms for material and imagined spaces respectively) do not fully encompass
