For more than three years the structure of cyclones at both poles of the nearest to us gas giant remained stable but on November 3 2019 on the 22nd rotation "Juno" found the birth of a new cyclone at the South Pole: it quickly "pushed" the previous (although still has a smaller size about 800 km) and now the centers of peripheral cyclones pole form almost right 6corner

Before Juno only the Galileo project
Jupiters geographic South Pole is also the location of its Magnetosphere of Jupiter
