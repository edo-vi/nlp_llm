The Gravity Gradient Stabilization Experiment (GGSE4) was a technology satellite launched in 1967  This was ostensibly the GGSE1
History
GGSE4 was launched by the US Airforce from Vandenberg Air Force Base atop a Thor AgenaD rocket 
GGSE4 remained operational from 1967 through 1972

It is alleged that the real name of GGSE4 was POPPY 5B or POPPY 5b and that it was a US National Reconnaissance Office satellite designed to collect signals intelligence; POPPY 5B was part of a 7satellite mission  A partial subset of information about POPPY was declassified in 2005

Other sources say that GGSE4 weighed only 10 pounds but that it was attached to the much larger Poppy 5 which would have weighed 85&nbsp;kg and featured an 18meter boom
It is further alleged that GGSE4s mass is not at all like GGSE1s mass and that GGSE4 weighs 85&nbsp;kg

2020 nearmiss
On  GGSE4 was expected to pass as closely as 12 meters  from IRAS another undeorbited satellite left aloft  IRAS was launched in 1983 and abandoned after a 10month mission  The 147kilometer per second pass had an estimated risk of collision of 5% Further complications arose from the fact that GGSE4 was outfitted with an 18 meter long stabilization boom that was in an unknown orientation and may have struck the satellite even if the spacecrafts main body did not Initial observations from amateur astronomers seemed to indicate that both satellites had survived the pass with the Californiabased debris tracking organization LeoLabs later confirming that they had detected no new tracked debris following the incident
