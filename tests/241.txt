Zamia staggers is a fatal nervous disease affecting cattle in areas where they browse on the leaves or fruit of cycads—in particular those of the genus Zamia (thus the name)  It is characterised by irreversible paralysis of the hind legs because of the degeneration of the spinal cord  It is caused by the toxins cycasin and macrozamin βglycosides (the sugars of which are glucose and primeverose respectively) of methylazoxymethanol acetate
Following ingestion the sugar is removed by bacterial glycosidase in the gut with the MAM being absorbed  The metabolized toxin produces tumours of the liver kidney intestine and brain after a latent period which may be a year or longer  The disease has been known in Australia since the 1860s and was the subject of a Government of Queensland
