Clients felt experiences can arise directly from the held places or from life events both present and past  This nonjudgmental noticing and listening by the practitioner helps clients to identify unconscious patterns of muscular holdings feelings and learned behavioral responses Rosen Method Bodywork therefore is presumed to help clients have greater access to their interoception their ability to feel the inner condition of the body  Research studies show that higher levels of interception are connected to greater resilience improved immune function and the reduction of stress anxiety and depression

The main theory underpinning this method is that a person protects themselves from past painful experiences through tightening muscles in the body that are involved in emotional expression and suppression especially in the diaphragm the prime muscle of breathing  Chronic unconscious muscular tightening suppresses interoception and therefor separates one from ones true self since many interoceptive sensations feelings and emotional responses have not been able to be felt in the body and thus cannot be known acted upon or modulated in the present This alleged protection against feeling and knowing how past difficult experiences are underlying ones perceptions beliefs and experience of living is said to be experienced most frequently as chronic musculoskeletal pain and tension

This tension and resulting pain can purportedly be observed by the bodywork practitioners as restricted patterns of movement and posture muscular tension or shortness of breath

Through the relaxation which "unlocks" these unconscious patterns Rosen Method Bodywork purports to integrate the body mind emotions and spirit As in many other spiritual methods which seek to free the breath the breath is viewed as a "gateway to awareness" The diapragm muscle relaxes and the breath is less constrained when one feels safe or solves a problem or has a true insight that brings more understanding of the self and the world  The naturally full breath of a released diaphragm is one of the elements of spiritual or transcendent experience in which ones personal boundaries become more expansive and permeable and one feels connected to something greater than oneself connected to all that there is in the universe 

Quackwatch categorized Rosen Method Bodywork as an "unnaturalistic method" these studies do not meet the requirements of large randomized and controlled population samples

Rosen Method bodywork has developed through its founder Marion Rosens physical therapy practice and work with Lucy Heyer a student of Elsa Gindler Under Rosens guidance in 1980 the Rosen Institute (RI) was formed as the governing international organization that protects and sustains the quality and standards of Rosen Method  The Rosen Institute has affiliate training centers in 16 countries and has certified 1150 bodywork practitioners and 150 movement teachers
