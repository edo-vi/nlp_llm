Simplexvirus bovinealpha2 also known as Bovine alphaherpesvirus 2 (BoHV2) is a virus of the family Herpesviridae It causes two diseases in cattle bovine mammillitis and pseudolumpy skin disease

 Pathology 
Pseudolumpy skin disease was originally discovered in South Africa where a similar but more serious disease caused by a poxvirus lumpy skin disease is also prevalent  Symptoms include fever and skin nodules on the face back and perineum  The disease heals within a few weeks  Bovine mammillitis is characterized by lesions restricted to the teats and udder  BoHV2 probably spreads through an arthropod Vector (epidemiology)
A review publication from 2011 presents a series of controversial but scientifically based conclusions concerning the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the infection among these that spread among cattle is preferably by the respiratory route and that skin lesions result from viremic spread to epidermal foci and inflammation due to complement activation by the classical pathway at sites of virus propagation after formation of early antibody to BoHV2 Lesions may be aggravated by low skin temperature (eg in edematic or hairless skin areas) causing reduced blood circulation and hampered removal of celltoxic inflammatory substances

 Morphology 
BoHV2 is similar in structure to human herpes simplex virus
