The discipline of evidencebased toxicology (EBT) strives to transparently consistently and objectively assess available scientific evidence in order to answer questions in toxicology the study of the adverse effects of chemical physical or biological agents on living organisms and the environment including the prevention and amelioration of such effects  EBT has the potential to address concerns in the toxicological community about the limitations of current approaches to assessing the state of the science These include concerns related to transparency in decision making synthesis of different types of evidence and the assessment of bias and credibility Evidencebased toxicology has its roots in the larger movement towards evidencebased practices

By analogy to evidencebased medicine (EBM) the umbrella term evidencebased toxicology (EBT) has been coined to group all approaches intended to better implement the abovementioned evidencebased principles in toxicology in general and in toxicological decisionmaking in particular Besides systematic reviews the core evidencebased tool such approaches include inter alia the establishment and universal use of a common ontology justified design and rigorous conduct of studies consistently structured and detailed reporting of experimental evidence probabilistic uncertainty and risk assessment and the development of synthesis methodology to integrate evidence from diverse evidence streams eg from human observational studies animal studies in vitro studies and in silico modeling A main initial impetus for translating evidencebased approaches to toxicology was the need to improve the performance assessment of toxicological test methods  The US National Research Council (NRC) concurs that new means of assessment are needed to keep pace with recent advances in the development of toxicological test methods capitalizing on enhanced scientific understanding through modern biochemistry and molecular biology 

A key tool in evidencebased medicine that holds promise for EBT is the systematic review  Historically authors of reviews assessing the results of toxicological studies on a particular topic have searched selected and weighed the scientific evidence in a nonsystematic and nontransparent way  Due to their narrative nature these reviews tend to be subjective potentially biased and not readily reproducible Assessments of BPA range from low risk of harm to the public to potential risks (for some populations) leading to different political decisions Systematic reviews can help reducing such divergent views In contrast with narrative reviews they reflect a highly structured approach to reviewing and synthesizing the scientific literature while limiting bias  The steps to carrying out a systematic review include framing the question to be addressed; identifying and retrieving relevant studies; determining if any retrieved studies should be excluded from the analysis; and appraising the included studies in terms of their methodological quality and risk of bias  Ultimately the data should be synthesized across studies if possible by a metaanalysis  A protocol of how the review will be conducted is prepared ahead of time and ideally should be registered and/or published

Scientists have made progress in their efforts to apply the systematic review framework to evaluating the evidence for associations between environmental toxicants and human health risks  To date researchers have shown that important elements of the framework established in evidencebased medicine can be adapted to toxicology with little change and some studies have been attempted Researchers using the systematic review methodology to address toxicological concerns include a group of scientists from government industry and academia in North America and the European Union (EU) who have joined together to promote evidencebased approaches to toxicology through the nonprofit Evidencebased Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC)  The EBTC brings together the international toxicology community to develop EBT methodology and facilitate the use of EBT to inform regulatory environmental and public health

 Background 

Evidencebased approaches were first conceived as a means of anchoring policy decisions not to current practices or the beliefs of experts but to experimental evidence  Evidencebased medicine (EBM) was launched slightly later Its rise as a distinct discipline is generally credited to the work and advocacy of Scottish epidemiologist Archie Cochrane  The Cochrane Collaboration named in his honor was launched at Oxford University in 1993 to promote evidencebased reviews of clinical medical literature More recently EBM expanded to encompass evidencebased health care (EBHC)

EBM/HC involves the conscientious explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients taking patients preferences into account  Prior to EBM medical decisions about diagnosis prevention treatment or harm were often made without a rigorous evaluation of the alternatives  Research in the 1970s and 1980s showed that different physicians regularly recommended different treatments and tests for patients with ailments that were essentially the same and that large proportions of procedures being performed by physicians were considered inappropriate by the standards of medical experts
EBM/HC supporters stress that while evidence always has been important to the practice of medicine EBM/HC provides an enhanced approach of identifying assessing and summarizing evidence  EBTs supporters make a similar argument

The idea of translating evidencebased approaches from medicine to toxicology has been percolating for two decades with proponents in both medicine and toxicology  Three research papers published in 2005 and 2006 catalyzed what eventually became known as EBT by suggesting that EBMs established tools and concepts might serve as a prototype of evidencebased decisionmaking in toxicology

 Process and progress 

The First International Forum Toward EvidenceBased Toxicology was held in 2007 The forum was organized by the European Commission and attended by 170 scientists from more than 25 European American and Asian countries  The goal was to explore the available concepts of EBT and to launch an initiative to formally implement evidencebased assessment methods in toxicology

The starting point for the discussions were two research papers suggesting that the tools and concepts established in evidencebased medicine could serve as a prototype of evidencebased decisionmaking for evaluating toxicological data  Apparent fundamental differences between medicine and toxicology were carefully considered during these discussions  Forum participants attempted to bridge the two disciplines in order to make use of the accrued wisdom and apply this approach to toxicology  (See http://wwwebtoxorg/resources/evidencebasedtoxicologyexplained/   )

The proceedings of this forum were published as a special issue in Human & Experimental Toxicology

EBTs proponents include experts in EBM public health and toxicology who believe that EBT can help toxicologists to better serve the goals of health protection and safety assurance They argue that EBTs methodologies for collecting appraising and pooling evidence can help ensure that all available information on a given topic is evaluated in a transparent unbiased and reproducible manner They contend that EBTs concept of the systematic review could prove particularly helpful for the standardization and quality assurance of novel methodologies for evaluating toxicity as well as for their formal validation  In this regard EBT may prove particularly useful for assessing the performance of newer nonanimal "21st century" toxicology tools  EBT can also help scientists integrate new toxicological test methods into test strategies being implemented across the globe

In 2010 a group of EBT supporters joined together to convene a workshop titled "21st Century Validation for 21st Century Tools"  The session on the potential for evidencebased approaches to assess the performance of the new generation of nonanimal test methods inspired the formation of the EBTC   The EBTC was officially launched in the US in 2011 at a Society of Toxicology conference and convened its first workshop in 2012

In 2014 the EBTC hosted a workshop on ‘The Emergence of Systematic Review and Related Evidencebased Approaches in Toxicology" with speakers representing US and European organizations that are implementing and promoting the use of systematic reviews for toxicological questions  The experts noted that the structured approach of systematic reviews increases objectivity and transparency but also made clear that the approach requires a substantial time investment which is a challenge to its more widespread adoption Consequently the participants called for close collaboration of interested organizations which they determined to be a prerequisite for the broad and efficient introduction of systematic reviews in toxicology

 Applications of EBT 

 Regulatory decisionmaking 

Some scientists and policymakers would like EBT to help them combine information from various sources  Toxicological evidence can be assigned to evidence streams sets of studies representing the same type or level of evidence such as human (observational) studies animal studies in vitro or mechanistic studies  EBT can be applied both within one evidence stream and it is especially wellsuited to be applied across multiple evidence streams  Regulators often designate one study as "the lead study" then use later studies as additional information  Many perceive this as unsatisfying but objective approaches to combine study results are lacking The EBM concept of the systematic review has promise for this application and some structured reviews serve as forerunners for this approach


 Evaluating effects of environmental exposures 

The US National Toxicology Programs Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) has started to use systematic review methodology for the programs evaluations  The first systematic review was completed in 2016 reviewing the effects of fluoride on learning and memory in animal studies  OHAT’s approach is tailored to its mandate but its seems especially appropriate for substances with substantial yet conflicting literature and hence the need for systematic reviews to sort out somewhat confusing situations

 Causation 

One application of EBT focuses on causation  Some experts warn that this approach could increase the evidence burden for proving causation and thereby increase the difficulty involved in banning toxic substances

 Clinical toxicology 

Practitioners of clinical toxicology which is concerned with the treatment of patients known to be exposed to toxic substances are also beginning to use an EBMstyle approach  Guidance documents based on this approach have already been published

 21st century toxicology 

The National Research Councils (NRC) landmark 2007 publication Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century has also been an impetus for EBT EBT provides new tools for assessing test method performance  Also as the focus of 21stcentury toxicology shifts from animal biology to human biology EBT provides a method for comparatively evaluating the results gleaned from new methods of investigating the effects of chemical exposure

The Evidencebased Toxicology Collaboration has pioneered a number of projects aimed at applying EBT approaches and systematic reviews to test methods comparison

 Limitations and challenges 

The specific differences between toxicology and medicine/health care cause challenges for implementing EBT Evidencebased methodology of clinical research has been focused on a single type of study—randomized controlled clinical trials which are a direct measure of the effectiveness of the health care intervention under scrutiny  In contrast toxicology employs a variety of different kinds of studies in three distinct evidence streams:  human (observational) studies animal studies and nonanimal studies  Because human evidence is frequently lacking most evidence is obtained by using animal and nonanimal models which—by definition—is more difficult to generalize and extrapolate to humans  This methodological heterogeneity complicates evidence integration within an evidence stream such as when inconsistent evidence is obtained from different animal species but even more so across evidence streams  Adding to the difficulty is the reality that much toxicological evidence more so than in medicine and health care is not readily accessible in the literature  Moreover the role of expert judgment especially in systematic reviews needs to be clearly defined as it is a common misperception that evidencebased approaches leave no room for it  Systematic reviews should strive to make expert judgments clear along with the scientific basis for those judgments in developing conclusions for a systematic review  Further issues to be worked out include exposures to multiple substances the multitude of outcomes observed in some animal studies and challenges in improving the experimental designs and reporting of studies
