Agada is one of the eight branches into which ayurveda medicine is traditionally divided Literally gada means a disease and agada means any agent which makes the body free from disease; however the term agada is used specifically for the branch of medicine dealing with toxicology the description of the different types of poisons and their antidotes

Agada Tantra is defined as a section of toxicology that deals with food poisoning snakebites dog bites insect bites etc The school of toxicology was founded and expounded upon by Kashyapa also known as Vriddhakashyapa a contemporary of Atreya Punarvasu He lived in Taxila
The traditional practice of toxicology is still practiced by different families of vishavaidyas (poison doctors) who specialize in toxicology However their knowledge is limited compared to the knowledge possessed by the earlier ayurvedic physicians In ancient times it was the job of Vishavaidyas to protect members of the royal families
