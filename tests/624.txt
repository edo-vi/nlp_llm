Funginite is a maceral a component organic in origin of coal or oil shale that exhibits several different physical properties and characteristics under particular conditions and its dimensions are based upon its source and place of discovery Furthermore it is primarily part of a group of macerals that naturally occur in rocks containing mostly carbon constituents specifically coal Due to its nature research into the chemical structure and formula of funginite is considered limited and lacking According to Chen et al referencing ICCP 2001 (International Committee for Coal and Organic Petrology) alongside the maceral secretinite they "are both macerals of the inertinite group which is more commonly known as fossilized charcoal and were previously jointly classified as the maceral sclerotinite" In the scientific community the discernment between the two does not remain entirely clear but there are slight particular and specific differences in regards to the composition between both It is also the product of fungal development on these carbon rich sedimentary rocksFile:FiresintheCenozoicalatefloweringofflammableecosystemsfpls0500749g001jpg
 Etymology 
The term "funginite" is based on the word "fungus" that has its roots in Latin and evolved through to Middle English
 Properties 
Funginites chemical composition consists primarily of carbon and hydrogen and when compared to other macerals in the same group of inertinites its theoretical carbon to oxygen ratio was discovered to be low in comparison

In terms of its official classification and designation funginite is a part of the teloinertinite subgroup which is part of the inertinite group of macerals

Funginite also contains higher amounts of carbon and lower amounts of hydrogen than its maceral counterparts due to the nature of inertinites as they generally "contain higher proportions of elementalcarbon and lower proportions of elementalhydrogen compared to vitrinites and liptinites" File:Cannel coal (Cannel CityAmburgy Coal Zone Middle Pennsylvanian; Jackson North Rt 15 roadcut Breathitt County Kentucky USA) 4 (29371472973)jpg
 Reflectance and Fluorescence 
Among the other maceral categories funginite can also be classified under huminite and/or vitrinite Funginite along with other macerals that fall in the same family such as cutinite and sporinite according to one study exhibits an average reflectance value of 081% with a standard deviation of 005 The physical characteristics of the "fungal bodies" not only fluctuate and vary but also determine the constitution of the spores by causing them to be identified as either single celled or multicelled by nature This was done alongside resinite and the four coal samples had several trials conducted The results indicated that funginite was "Fluorescence
 Formation 
Funginite is primarily found in coal due to the nature of its creation process which involves a fungal spore or body contaminating resin within trees and undergoing the heat and pressure process of transformation into coal and other carbon rich substances which is best summarized as when a "fungus enters a wound in the tree or in the process of rotting the wood or bark can be encapsulated through the release of a resin" which is known as the process of cicatrization Other methods of fungi being incorporated into resin for the potential formation of funginite may also involve insects or other similar organisms that are carrying the fungal matter to be trapped or even purposefully store said material into the resin unlike the third main possible method that is a result of the aforementioned fungi in question utilizing the resin as sustenance

Funginites development and more broadly inertinite in general occurs in forests due to the nature of its properties and characteristics According to Mastalerz et al 2011 of the primary groups of macerals inertinites with a high level of fluorescence and reflectance have these particular traits attributed to the temperature of the fires in which they are formed under as simply put their "reflectance is directly related to the fire temperature" Furthermore given the nature of macerals in general and how they are based on formerly living organisms this generally results in higher concentrations of funginite being found in such locations when coal and charcoal are inspected closely at these sites Funginite is based on fungal spores and the density of fungal material being present in forests is considered abundantly higher than in other common locations for inertinites

The research undertaken into funginite as well as other similar inertinites may provide clues into understanding the events of instances regarding natural spontaneous combustion due to the necessary requirements for that event to occur

Increased studies into funginite as a constituent of coal may also assist in the identification and selection of metallurgical coal as it is a fundamental aspect of producing Coke (fuel)

 Discovery 
File:Fluorescence in coalpngAccording to Hower et al referencing Jeffrey and Chrysler 1906 Berkeley 1848 and Thomas 1848 fungal constituents and matter are not "new" in the realm of coal and its formation and the traces of fungal substances in resin fossilized or not predates that discovery even further Further research is being done in regards to small xray angle scattering and small angle neutron scattering Smallangle Xray scattering
