Comedy of menace is the body of plays written by David Campton Nigel Dennis N F Simpson and Harold Pinter  The term was coined by drama critic Irving Wardle who borrowed it from the subtitle of Camptons play The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace in reviewing Pinters and Camptons plays in Encore (magazine)
Background

Citing Wardles original publications in Encore magazine (1958) Susan Hollis Merritt points out that in "Comedy of Menace" Wardle "first applies this label to Pinters work … describing Pinter as one of several playwrights who have been tentatively lumped together as the "nonnaturalists" or "abstractionists"&nbsp; (28)" (Merritt 225)  His article "Comedy of Menace" Merritt continues
<blockquote>centers on The Birthday Party (play)
In "Comedy of Menace" as Merritt observes on the basis of his experience of The Birthday Party and others accounts of the other two plays Wardle proposes that "Comedy enables the committed agents and victims of destruction to come on and off duty; to joke about the situation while oiling a revolver; to display absurd or endearing features behind their masks of implacable resolution; to meet … in paper hats for a game of blind mans buff"; he suggests how "menace" in Pinters plays "stands for something more substantial: destiny" and that destiny "handled in this way—not as an austere exercise in classicism but as an incurable disease which one forgets about most of the time and whose lethal reminders may take the form of a joke—is an apt dramatic motif for an age of conditioned behaviour in which orthodox man is a willing collaborator in his own destruction" (Wardle "Comedy of Menace" 33; rpt in The Encore Reader 91)

"Just two years later" (1960) however Wardle retracted "Comedy of Menace" in his review of The Caretaker stating: "On the strength of The Birthday Party and the pair of oneacters I rashly applied the phrase comedy of menace to Pinters writing  I now take it back" ("Theres Music" 130 as qtd in Merritt 225–26)

After Wardles retraction of comedy of menace as he had applied it to Pinters writing Pinter himself also occasionally disavowed it and questioned its relevance to his work (as he  also did with his own offhand but apt statement that his plays are about "the weasel under the cocktail cabinet")  For example in December 1971 in his interview with Pinter about Old Times Mel Gussow recalled that "After The Homecoming Pinter said that he couldnt any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out  Landscape (play)
Despite Wardles retraction of comedy of menace (and Pinters later qualifications) Comedy of menace and comedies of menace caught on and have been prevalent since the late 1950s in advertisements and in critical accounts notices and reviews to describe Pinters early plays and some of his later work as well  As Merritt points out among other examples of critics usage of this and similar categories of Pinters work after Gussows 1971 "conversation" with Pinter "Though he echoes Wardles concept Gussow seems to avoid using comedy of menace when reviewing the CSC Repertory Theatres 1988 production of The Birthday Party  While still emphasizing Pinters terrors and the shiver beneath the laughter Gussow describes the play as a play of intrigue with an underlying motif of betrayal … and Bernard F Dukore calls the play a comedy (of menace or otherwise) … (Merritt 10)

Selected examples from Pinters plays and sketches

The Birthday Party (1958)

In discussing the first production of Pinters first fulllength play The Birthday Party (play)
The Dumb Waiter (1960)

In his second oneact play The Dumb Waiter (1960) as accentuated through the 2008 film by Martin McDonagh closely resembling and markedly influenced by it In Bruges "Pinter conveys the idea of political terror through the staccato rhythms of music hall
"A nearperfect play about the testiness of a collapsing partnership and the divideandrule tactics of authority" according to Billington The Dumb Waiter focuses on two characters Gus and Ben; Gus is "the man who questions the agreed system and who is ultimately destroyed by his quest for meaning"; Ben "the man who blindly obeys orders and thereby places himself at risk  (If the system can arbitrarily dispose of his partner why not of him?)" (92)  As Pinters The Dumb Waiter has been categorised as a "comedy of menace" so may be  McDonaghs In Bruges as it closely resembles it; yet despite the comedy and the sense of threat growing out of the menace these works of Pinter and McDonagh are in Pinters words to Billington also "doing something which can be described as political" (92)  At the same time Pinter had – and still in 1996 through to the time of his death in 2008 has – an acute sense of the fragility of earthly happiness and of the terrors that haunt us even from infancy" (92)

The "punning title" of The Dumb Waiter Billington observes "carries several layers of meaning": "It obviously refers to the antique servinghatch that despatches sic ever more grotesque orders for food to these bickering gunmen"—the dumbwaiter (elevator)
Billington adds:
<blockquote>This being Pinter the play has a metaphorical openness  You can interpret it as an Theatre of the absurd
The comedy in this "comedy of menace" often derives from such arguments between Gus and Ben especially the one that occurs when "Ben tells Gus to go and light the kettle" a "semantic nitpicking that is a standard part of musichall comedy": "All the great stage and film double acts – Jimmy Jewel
:dialogue


As Billington observes further
<blockquote>This kind of comic pedantry has precise echoes of the great Sid Field – ironically since the city is the setting of this play a Birmingham comic – who had a famous sketch in which he played a virgin of the greens being hectored by Jerry Desmondes golf pro who would cry in exasperation When I say "Slowly Back" I dont mean "Slowly Back" I mean "Slowly Back"&nbsp; At another moment the bullying pro would tell the hapless Sid to get behind the ball and he would vainly protest But its behind all round it But where in a musichall sketch this kind of semantic byplay was its own justification in Pinter it becomes a crucial part of the powerstructure  … The payoff comes when Gus having dogmatically insisted that the accurate phrase is put on the kettle suddenly finds an irritated Ben adopting the right usage (91)</blockquote>

"Everything" in The Dumb Waiter Billington observes "contributes towards a necessary end"; for "the image as Pete says in Pinters only novel The Dwarfs (novel)
:dialogue


The crucial significance of the omission becomes clear only at the very end of the play when "Gus enters through the door stageright – the one marked for the intended victim – stripped of his gun and holster"; it becomes clear that he is going to be "Bens target" (Billington 92) as Bens "revolver is levelled at the door" though the play ends before Ben fires any shot (Pinter The Dumb Waiter 121)

The Caretaker (1960)

In an entry on Pinter for the 1969 edition of The Encyclopedia of World Drama cited by Merritt Wardle repeats and updates some of his first perspective on comedy of menace as he had applied it initially to Pinters writing:
<blockquote>Early in his writing career Pinter admitted to three influences: Franz Kafka American gangster films and Samuel Beckett    At that time his plays more than those of any other plawrights  were responsible for the newly coined term comedy of menace  This phrase certainly makes sense when applied to The Birthday Party (play)
Despite those morerecent caveats regarding applying the phrase that he himself initially coined for Pinters writing to The Caretaker—only the second of Pinters fulllength plays produced by then and the one that launched his career as a successful playwright in 1960 (Merritt 9 226) —and to Pinters later plays scenes in both acts of The Caretaker in which Mick confronts an unsuspecting Davies and scares him almost speechless (Pinter The Caretaker 129 146) also epitomise how comedy and menace still coexist in Pinters text and on Pinters stage

The comic aspects of this play multiply reaching a crescendo in Micks monologue in Act Two describing his "deepest wishes" for decorating the attic room (161 173) and falling with Davies a tramp taken in out of the cold by his brother suggesting that "if" he can "just get down to Sidcup" to get his "papers" and "sort" himself "out" (113–16 164) his refrain and excuse for everything (153 175–79) he might just be able to accomplish Micks hyperbolic pipe dream and "decorate the attic room out for Mick" (164) leading Mick to accuse Davies of misrepresenting himself as "an experienced firstclass professional interior and exterior decorator" (172–74) an absurd conclusion given the tangible evidence of the downandout Davies before Mick (and the audience)

Pinters friend the late film and stage director David Jones (director)<blockquote>There is always mischief lurking in the darkest corners The world of The Caretaker is a bleak one its characters damaged and lonely But they are all going to survive And in their dance to that end they show a frenetic vitality and a wry sense of the ridiculous that balance heartache and laughter Funny but not too funny As Pinter wrote back in 1960: "As far as I am concerned The Caretaker IS funny up to a point Beyond that point it ceases to be funny and it is because of that point that I wrote it" (Jones)</blockquote>
"Beyond the point" of the comedy (the "funny") lies the scary territory that threatens ones very existence (Billington 92) which Wardle and others commonly have "labeled" or "pigeonholed" (depending on ones perspective) as "menace" (Merritt 9–10)

Pinters later plays

Though "comedy of menace" is generally applied to Pinters early work of the late 1950s through the middle of the 1960s including The Collection (play)
Celebration (2000)

While reviewers and other audience members describe Celebration (play)
One set (the two couples seated at Table One) consists of brothers Lambert and Matt and their wives Prue and Julie who are sisters; the second set of diners (the couple seated at Table Two) consists of a banker and his young wife Suki who comically turns out to have had an affair with Lambert when she was 18 (Billington 104)

As the "maître dhôtel" emits platitudes geared to elevate the nouveaux riches in their own imagined esteem ("I believe the concept of this restaurant rests in that public house of my childhood" Pinter Celebration 371) the "maîtress dhôtel" appears to dwell on a peculiar past family and sex life (373–74) while the Waiter engages in "interjections" spinning fantasied impossible memories of a grandfather who knew writers other artists and various other public figures of multiple decades and geographical locations too far apart to have been experienced personally in one mans lifetime (367 375)

Lambert and Matt reveal themselves to be rather uncouth bullies ("Teddy boys" according to some London reviews)—who describe themselves as "consultants … Strategy consultants … It means we dont carry guns  … We dont have to! … Were peaceful strategy consultants … Worldwide  Keeping the peace (379) Strategy consultant could be a euphemism
:dialogue


As the banker Russell interprets their explanation peaceful strategy consultants seems vaguely menacing: "We need more people like you  Taking responsibility  Taking charge  Keeping the peace  Enforcing the peace  Enforcing peace  We need more like you" (379)  This speech stressing "force" (in the repetitions of Enforcing) occurs after Russell has already revealed his own ilk:

:dialogue


Lambert and Matt are distantly reminiscent of Gus and Ben from The Dumb Waiter; but distinctly less polite while living much higher on the hog  One imagines such characters 
"strategically" plotting the "peaceful" rendition of others without any qualms while sipping Perrier and simultaneously planning their next weddinganniversary dinner celebration (perhaps with a different set of wives) on their Mobile phone
As the Waiter says in his apparently penultimate "interjection" in which one might detect intimations of mortality:

:dialogue


"Apart From That" (Sketch) (2006)

Pinter mocks mobile phones comically in an ostensiblytrivial wireless conversation while still suggesting a residual bit of menace in the unsaid developed as his last revue sketch Apart From That (sketch)
