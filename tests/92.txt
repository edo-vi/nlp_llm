The Maccabiah bridge collapse was the catastrophic failure of a pedestrian bridge over the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv Israel on July 14 1997 The collapse of the temporary metal and wooden structure killed four and injured more than 60 Australian athletes and other team delegates who were visiting Israel to participate in the Maccabiah Games One athlete died in the collapse and three died afterwards due to infections caused by exposure to the polluted river water A subsequent investigation found that negligent shortcuts had been taken in the bridges construction mandatory permits and oversight had not been obtained and the bridges construction did not meet government requirements

Five people including the engineer who designed the bridge and the chair of the Tel Aviv Games Organising Committee were convicted of recklessly causing death and injury Four served prison sentences The fifth the committee chairman served a term of community service and was reappointed to a highlypaid management position in 2002 In 2004 after lengthy lawsuit delays the deceased and the injured were awarded close to $20 million in damages The disaster highlighted environmental problems in Israel especially with regard to its rivers and waterways prompting cleanup efforts A full Australian team returned to the games in 2005 and participated in a riverside ceremony unveiling a memorial to the victims of the collapse

Background

The Maccabiah Games organized by Maccabi World Union (MWU) and first staged in 1932 is an athletic event held every four years in Tel Aviv Israel to celebrate the History of Israel1897â€”1917: The Zionist Revolution
The 1997 Maccabiah Games
Collapse
As scheduled during the opening ceremony the participating athletes teamed with their respective national delegations began to cross the bridge and enter the stadium in alphabetical order The second nation to cross the bridge following the Austrian team consisted of the 373 members of the Australian delegation As the Australian athletes in parallel rows of six crossed the river the bridges support beams at roughly midspan snapped plunging around 100 of the Australians eight metres into the river below Several of the fallen were forcibly submerged in the 16metre deep river by the weight of falling athletes above them Dozens struggled to get out of the river and many linked arms to form a human chain to pull each other out Some of the fallen were caught in the bridges twisted beams

Other athletes bystanders event staff soldiers and police leapt into the river to rescue the fallen About 20 ambulances were rushed to the scene and helicopters with spotlights and divers were sent in to assist in rescue efforts Due to the Yarkon Rivers banks being steep and muddy rescuers had to use ropes to descend to the waters edge Inside the stadium Israeli government officials including President of Israel
The injured were taken to nearby Rabin Medical Center
Infections

Patrick Surkin who ran the intensive care unit at Tel Aviv Medical Centre wondered whether a toxin might be the culprit behind the infections He contacted David Pargament chief of the Yarkon RiverYarkon River Authority
Bowler Yetty Bennett 50 died later that day from asphyxia Elizabeth Sawicki 47 a member of the delegations Contract bridge
An autopsy of Zines finally identified the source of the infections as the fungus Pseudallescheria boydii a rare but serious cause of pneumonia and disseminated infection subsequent to neardrowning This species of fungus typically found in stagnant or polluted water is resistant to nearly all available drug therapies Disseminated infection can spread to the brain kidneys heart and thyroid

After Zines death one athlete tennis player Sasha Elterman 15 remained in critical condition at Schneider Childrens Medical Centre in Petah Tikva Elterman underwent 18 surgeries in the six months after the collapse 13 of them brain surgeries In total she received 28 brain surgeries and two lung operations Ten other athletes who returned to Australia shortly after the accident were admitted to hospitals with respiratory problems but recovered

Investigations
Israels deputy minister of education Moshe Peled (politician)
Irgunit subcontracted the bridges construction to Baruch Karagula and Yehoshua BenEzra (also known as "BenEzra Construction") The commission found that Karagula and Ezra were not licensed to build bridges had never attempted to build a bridge and used substandard materials in the bridges construction Photographs taken after the collapse showed that the bridge was constructed of rusty metal pipes bound together with wire

The commission concluded that the bridges engineer Micha BarIlan did not submit a blueprint for the bridge designed a bridge that was inadequate for its intended use and did not properly supervise or coordinate the bridges construction The commission faulted the Maccabiah Games organizers for poor coordination and oversight over the bridges assembly

An investigation by Augustine Zycher for the AIJAC
According to Zycher Mishori kept $7700 of the payment and gave the rest to Karagula and BenEzra to erect the bridge Karagula and BenEzra hired BarIlan to design and oversee the bridges construction BarIlan claimed that his bridge as designed would support 250&nbsp;kg per square metre which did not meet Israeli government standards which required a pedestrian bridge to support 500&nbsp;kg per square metre In any event the Dotan investigation found that the bridge was far weaker than what BarIlan claimed Furthermore a municipal permit was required to construct the bridge which Karagula and BenEzra did not obtain The municipality in which the bridge was constructed was Ramat Gan Zvi Bar Ramat Gans mayor and head of the city planning division which issued construction permits was a member of the Maccabiah committee that helped select Irgunit Bar apparently did not ensure that Irgunit Karagula or BenEzra obtained the necessary permit and made no effort to ensure that the bridge as constructed was safe

In 1998 the Knesset commissioned an independent inquiry into the collapse led by Eliezer Sandberg

Criminal trial

During the trial Sheba Hospital microbiologist Doctor Natan Keller testified that normally the Yarkon River water would not have posed a hazard to humans Keller stated that it was the collapse of the bridge and the thrashing of the people in the water which had agitated the fungus from the river bottom where it normally resided supporting the prosecutions argument that the pollution in the river would not have posed a risk to the athletes if the bridge had not collapsed The defense in turn argued that the police should have shared responsibility in the collapse as they had approved the building permit were charged with limiting the number of people on the bridge to 150 at one time and had possibly driven a police vehicle across the bridge the day before the opening ceremony

On the 17th of April 2000 the threejudge panel of the court found all five defendants guilty of causing death by negligence The defendants were sentenced on the 5th of June 2000 BarIlan was sentenced to one year and nine months in prison plus a suspended sentence of 21 months BenEzra and Karagula were given 15months in prison plus suspended sentences of two years Mishori served nine months in prison plus a suspended sentence of 15 months Eyal was sentenced to six months community service

Lawsuits
The families of the athletes who were killed plus Sasha Elterman and 50 others injured in the collapse sued MWU for damages in 1999 Progress in the lawsuits was initially delayed by a dispute among the parties over who should bear liability which was resolved by the criminal court convictions in 2000 Due to the ongoing litigation plus security concerns from the Second Intifada the Australians only sent 65 athletes to the 2001 Maccabiah games

The Haifa District Court eventually awarded the claimants almost $US20 million in compensation with the last judgement and payment made in 2004 The court ruled that the games insurance provider Phoenix Insurance Company was liable for about twothirds of the amount with the Israeli government responsible for the remainder

Environmental issues
The bridge accident highlighted Israels environmental issues especially pollution in the nations rivers and waterways Said Dror Avisar chief hydrologist for the Israel Union for Environmental Defense shortly after the collapse "Almost every major river inside Israel is polluted" The pollution in the waterways including the Yarkon was mainly due to untreated sewage and storm runoff hazardous chemicals industrial waste and other pollutants"

Aftermath and memorials
In 2002 MWU reinstated Yoram Eyal as an executive official and as general manager of the Kfar Maccabiah Village in Ramat Gan with an annual salary of US$120000 The village served as headquarters for MWU and the athletes village for the games Eyal refused all requests to be interviewed by Australian media In spite of protests from the Australian Jewish community about Eyals continued involvement with the games the MWU declined to separate him from the organization When asked about Eyals status in July 2007 MWU President Jeanne Futeran stated "Hes a good guy; he doesnt deserve to be further hassled over what happened Hes never forgiven himself; he never will forgive himself"

Australia sent a full team of 543 athletes to the Maccabiah Games in July 2005 almost a quarter of whom were present at the 1997 bridge collapse The Australian delegation requested that Eyal not be seated in the presidents box during the opening ceremony when the team entered the stadium Although the MWU responded that Eyal had a right to attend the ceremony in an official capacity Eyal acceded to the Australians request The Australian team declined to stay at the Maccabiah athletes village for the duration of the 2005 games
