Reception


Pascal Wyse of The Guardian referred to it as "virtuosic grossness" stating "there is more fleeting shock than real haunting Perhaps in all the synaptic mayhem there is just no room for the viewer to contact their own demons" Treblecom listed the film in its "10 Terrifying Music Videos" calling it "both hilarious and terrifying"

S McKeating of Stylus Magazine awarded Rubber Johnny a B+ rating lauding it as an "exceptionally entertaining odd short film" but only for viewers "with the right frame of mind" He additionally demanded that Cunningham "take it one step further and give us an hour and a half of warped material"
