Image:Castration instruments  Arppeanum  DSC05123JPGAn emasculator is a tool used in the castration of livestock Its function is to simultaneously crush and cut the spermatic cord preventing hemorrhaging while still detaching the testis from the animal

The blade is always on the side of the emasculator with the nut that holds the blades in place and should always be placed adjacent to the testis ("nut against nut") so that the crushing clamp occludes the spermatic artery preventing lifethreatening blood loss

The ratchet (visible on the handle) allows the emasculator to be locked in the "closed" position for the 2â€“3 minutes required for primary hemostasis to occur

The ends of the "clamp" are rounded and guarded to allow the emasculator to be placed over the testis and spermatic cord without cutting until pressure is applied
