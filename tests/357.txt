In 1950 Dillema was banned from competition for life by the IAAF Dillema had refused to go to a mandatory sex test for the European championships in Brussels in August 1950 Dillema was the first subject of a mandatory Gender verification in sports
On 13 July 1950 Dillema was stopped on her way to an international meeting in France by the Dutch athletics authorities and expelled for life from competition

After the ban
After Dillema was banned competition she returned home to Friesland and did not leave her house for at least one year She lived a quiet life in her home town afterwards and always refused to speak on the subject

She died on 5 December 2007 in Kollum Netherlands

Posthumous testing
Dillema having the typical female phenotype was designated female at birth raised as a girl and lived her life as a woman After her death a forensic test on body cells obtained from her clothing showed signs of a Ychromosome in her DNA She may have been a mosaic (genetics)
Her biographer Max Dohle concludes that Dillema having a Ychromosome would never have been allowed to race in the last 45 years The Barr body test (1966) as well as the test based on Polymerase chain reaction</ref>

Dohle concludes that Dillema was an intersex individual who had ovotesticular DSD She had an operation on her glands in 1952 During the operation testes or ovotestes were removed The SRYgene on the Y is the testis determining factor so Dillema may have had infertile testes or ovotestes palpable in her groin These ovotestes produce more testosterone than ovaries Higher testosterone levels were considered unfair towards the competition despite being an entirely natural feature of Dillemas physiology
