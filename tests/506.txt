Allusion is a figure of speech in which an object or circumstance from an unrelated context is referred to covertly or indirectly It is left to the audience to make a direct connection Where the connection is directly and explicitly stated (as opposed to indirectly implied) by the author it is instead usually termed a reference In the arts a literary allusion puts the alluded text in a new context under which it assumes new poetic function
In a wider more informal context an allusion is a passing or casually short statement indicating broader meaning It is an incidental mention of something either directly or by implication such as "In the stock market he met his Waterloo"

Scope of the term
File:NAMA Tablette 1287jpg
In the most traditional sense allusion is a literary term though the word has also come to encompass indirect references to any source including allusions in film or the visual arts In literature allusions are used to link concepts that the reader already has knowledge of with concepts discussed in the story In the field of film criticism a filmmakers intentionally unspoken visual reference to another film is also called an Homage (arts)
Without the hearer or reader comprehending the authors intention an allusion becomes merely a decorative device Allusion is an economical device a figure of speech that uses a relatively short space to draw upon the ready stock of ideas cultural memes or emotion already associated with a topic Thus an allusion is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the covert reference in question a mark of their cultural literacy

Allusion as cultural bond
The origin of  is from the Latin noun  "a playing with a reference to" from  "to play jest make fun of" a compound of  "to" +  "to play" Recognizing the point of allusions condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity between the maker of the allusion and the hearer: their shared familiarity with allusion bonds them Ted Cohen finds such a "cultivation of intimacy" to be an essential element of many jokes Some aspect of the referent must be invoked and identified for the tacit association to be made; the allusion is indirect in part because "it depends on something more than mere substitution of a referent"

The allusion depends as well on the authors intent; a reader may search out parallels to a figure of speech or a passage of which the author was unaware and offer them as unconscious allusions—coincidences that a critic might not find illuminating Addressing such issues is an aspect of hermeneutics

William Irwin remarks that allusion moves in only one direction: "If A alludes to B then B does not allude to A The Bible does not allude to Shakespeare though Shakespeare may allude to the Bible" Irwin appends a note: "Only a divine author outside of time would seem capable of alluding to a later text"  This is the basis for Christian readings of Bible prophecy
Allusion differs from the similar term intertextuality in that it is an intentional effort on the authors part The success of an allusion depends in part on at least some of its audience "getting" it Allusions may be made increasingly obscure until at last they are understood by the author alone who thereby retreats into a private language (eg "Ulalume" by Edgar Allan Poe)

Academic analysis of the concept of allusions
In discussing the richly allusive poetry of Virgils Georgics R F Thomas distinguished six categories of allusive reference which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere These types are:
  Casual reference "the use of language which recalls a specific antecedent but only in a general sense" that is relatively unimportant to the new context;
  Single reference in which the hearer or reader is intended to "recall the context of the model and apply that context to the new situation"; such a specific single reference in Virgil according to Thomas is a means of "making connections or conveying ideas on a level of intense subtlety";
  Selfreference where the locus is in the poets own work;
  Corrective allusion where the imitation is clearly in opposition to the original sources intentions;
  Apparent reference "which seems clearly to recall a specific model but which on closer inspection frustrates that intention"; and
  Multiple reference or conflation which refers in various ways simultaneously to several sources fusing and transforming the cultural traditions

A type of literature has grown round explorations of the allusions in such works as Alexander Popes The Rape of the Lock or T S Eliots The Waste Land

Examples
In Homer brief allusions could be made to mythic themes of generations previous to the main narrative because they were already familiar to the epics hearers: one example is the theme of the Calydonian Boar
Martin Luther King Jr alluded to the Gettysburg Address in starting his "I Have a Dream" speech by saying "Five score years ago"; his hearers were immediately reminded of Abraham Lincolns "Four score and seven years ago" which opened the Gettysburg Address Kings allusion effectively called up parallels in two historic moments without overwhelming his speech with details

A sobriquet is an allusion By metonymy one aspect of a person or other referent is selected to identify it and it is this shared aspect that makes a sobriquet evocative: for example "the city that never sleeps" is a sobriquet of (and therefore an allusion to) New York

An allusion may become trite and stale through unthinking overuse devolving into a mere cliché as is seen in some of the sections below

15 minutes of fame
Andy Warhol a 20thcentury American artist most famous for his popart images of Campbell Soup Company
Lots Wife/Pillar of Salt
According to the Book of Genesis chapter 19 God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah but Lot (biblical person)
An allusion Lots wife (disambiguation)
Cassandra
In Greek mythology Cassandra the daughter of Troy
Today a "Cassandra" is someone who accurately predicts disasters or negative outcomes especially if those predictions are disregarded

Catch22
This phrase comes from a novel by Joseph Heller Catch22 is set on a US Army Air Force base in World War II "Catch22" refers to a regulation that states an airmans request to be relieved from flight duty can only be granted if he is judged to be insane However anyone who does not want to fly dangerous missions is obviously sane; thus there is no way to avoid flying the missions

Later in the book the old woman in Rome explains that Catch22 means "They can do whatever they want to do" This refers to the theme of the novel in which the authority figures consistently abuse their powers leaving the consequences to those under their command

In common speech "catch22" has come to describe any absurd or nowin situation

T S Eliot
The poetry of T S Eliot is often described as "allusive" because of his habit of referring to names places or images that may only make sense in the light of prior knowledge This technique can add to the experience but for the uninitiated can make Eliots work seem dense and hard to decipher

James Joyce
The most densely allusive work in modern English may be Finnegans Wake by James Joyce Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson wrote A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake (1944) that unlocked some of Joyces most obscure allusions
