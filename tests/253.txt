File:Smallpox vaccinejpgFile:PoliodropsjpgVaccine wastage is the number of vaccines that have not been administered during vaccine deployment in an immunization program The wastage can occur at multiple stages of the deployment process and can take place in both unopened and opened vials or in oral admission It is an expected part of vaccination deployment and is factored into the manufacturing process
__TOC__
 Prevalence 
A 2018 study into Cambodia
A study from India which collected Universal Immunisation Programme data from two different locations (Kangra district
Parts of the United States has vaccine wastage tracking factored into the deployment process Reasons for vaccine wastage are categorised asâ€” broken vial/syringe lost or unaccounted for open but not all doses administered or drawn into a syringe but not administered Other reasons for wastage include contamination expiration and temperature issues In India covid vaccine wastage was 65% while in Scotland and Wales it was 18%

 Reduction 
Improving requirement estimates transportation and logistics wastage reporting optimal session sizes and usage of syringes and needles with low dead volume are important factors in reducing wastage While manufacturing single dose vials would considerably reduce vaccine wastage it would increase the cost of the manufacturing process However there are cases when single dose vials are optimum such as when administering vaccines to a limited number of people or single person sessions
