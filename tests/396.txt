Synopsis


The film begins with an extreme closeup of a television switching between channels while odd gibberish noises play in the background The film title is superimposed over the television screen

The scene fades to a shot of a factory (filmed at the Goodyear World of Rubber in Akron Ohio) Members of Devo in its quartet stage are seen in blue workmens suits operating machinery until one notices it is time to go All the band members wear clear face masks except for Mark Mothersbaugh who appears in his Booji Boy mask The members leave work and get into a car They pull up in front of the burned out Kent bar The Water Street Saloon which was two buildings down from JBs in Kent Ohio The next clip shows them entering the front door of JBs carrying instruments A sign on the door reads "Tonight: 156075" a reference to the Numbers Band which Gerald Casale played bass for at one point The "Secret Agent Man" performance begins featuring Bob Mothersbaugh on guitar Gerald Casale on bass Jim Mothersbaugh on electric bongos and Mark Mothersbaugh/Booji Boy on synthesizers The performance routinely cuts away to bizarre visuals such as two men in monkey masks spanking a woman with Table tennis
The "Jocko Homo" segment begins with Booji Boy running through a parking lot off of Front Street in Cuyahoga Falls Ohio
A series of rapidfire cuts of the letters in "DEVO" appears (with the music of "Mechanical Man" found on Hardcore Devo: Volume One) and then we cut to Mark Mothersbaugh in a Kent State University classroom (actually the Governance Chambers) delivering a lecture As Mothersbaugh delivers the lyrics to "Jocko Homo" (this version can also be found on Hardcore Devo: Volume One) the classroom enters a frenzy of excitement ending in a near riot

The film ends with a scene of Booji Boy being stabbed and his mask removed Then the credits play in a style similarly to the title with an extremely distorted cover of "Because (Beatles song)
