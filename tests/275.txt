A physical symbol system (also called a formal system) takes physical patterns (symbols) combining them into structures (expressions) and manipulating them (using processes) to produce new expressions

The physical symbol system hypothesis (PSSH) is a position in the philosophy of artificial intelligence formulated by Allen Newell and Herbert A Simon They wrote:

This claim implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is sufficient for intelligence)

The idea has philosophical roots in Hobbes (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning") Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
 Examples 

Examples of physical symbol systems include:
 Formal logic: the symbols are words like "and" "or" "not" "for all x" and so on The expressions are statements in formal logic which can be true or false  The processes are the rules of logical deduction
 Elementary algebra Chess: the symbols are the pieces the processes are the legal chess moves the expressions are the positions of all the pieces on the board
 A computer running a Computer program
The physical symbol system hypothesis claims that both of these are also examples of physical symbol systems:
 Intelligent human thought: the symbols are encoded in our brains The expressions are thoughts The processes are the mental operations of thinking
 English language: the symbols are words The expressions are sentences The processes are the mental operations that enable speaking writing or reading

 Evidence for the hypothesis  

Two lines of evidence suggested to Allen Newell and Herbert A Simon that "symbol manipulation" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence: psychological experiments on human beings and the development of artificial intelligence programs

 Psychological experiments and computer models 


Newell and Simon carried out Psychology
This type of research using both experimental psychology and computer models was called "computational cognition
This line of research suggested that human problem solving consisted primarily of the manipulation of highlevel symbols

 Artificial intelligence programs in the 1950s and 60s 


In the early decades of AI research there were many very successful programs that used highlevel symbol processing These programs were very successful demonstrating skills that many people at the time had assumed were impossible for machines such as solving Word problem (mathematics education) 
The success of these programs suggested that symbol processing systems could simulate any intelligent action

 Clarifications 

The physical symbol systems hypothesis becomes trivial incoherent or irrelevant unless we recognize a distinction between "digitized signals" and "symbols" between weak AI
 Semantic symbols vs dynamic signals  

The physical symbol system hypothesis is only interesting if we restrict the "symbols" to things that have a recognizable Meaning (semiotics)
David Touretzky and Dean Pomerleau consider what would follow if we interpret the "symbols" in the PSSH to be binary digits of digital hardware In this version of the hypothesis no distinction is being made between "symbols" and "signals" Here the physical symbol system hypothesis asserts merely that intelligence can be digitized This is a weaker claim Indeed David TouretzkyReconstructing Physical Symbol Systems

The same issue applies to the unidentified numbers that appear in the matrixes of a artificial neural network
 General intelligence vs "narrow" intelligence 

The PSSH refers to "general intelligent action"  that is to every activity that we would consider "intelligent" Thus it is the claim that artificial general intelligence can be achieved using only symbolic methods It does not refer to "weak AI
Artificial intelligence research has succeeded in developing many programs that are capable of intelligently solving particular problems However AI research has so far not been able to produce a system with artificial general intelligence  the ability to solve a variety of novel problems as human do 
Thus the criticism of the PSSH refers to the limits of AI in the future and does not apply to any current research or programs

 Consciousness vs intelligent action 

The PSSH refers to "intelligent action"  that is the behavior of the machine  it does not refer to the "mental states" "mind" "consciousness" or the "experiences" of the machine "Consciousness" as far as neurology can determine is not something that can deduced from the behavior of an agent: it is always possible that the machine is simulating the experience of consciousness without actually experiencing it similar to the way a perfectly written fictional character might simulate a person with consciousness 

Thus the PSSH is not relevant to positions which refer to "mind" or "consciousness" such as John Searles Chinese RoomStrong AIBlockquoteThe appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds

 Evidence against the hypothesis 
Nils Nilsson (researcher)The "erroneous claim that the physical symbol system hypothesis lacks symbol grounding" which is presumed to be a requirement for general intelligent action 
The common belief that AI requires nonsymbolic processing (that which can be supplied by a connectionist architecture for instance)
The common statement that the brain is simply not a computer and that "computation as it is currently understood does not provide an appropriate model for intelligence"
And last of all that it is also believed in by some that the brain is essentially mindless most of what takes place are chemical reactions and that human intelligent behaviour is analogous to the intelligent behaviour displayed for example by ant colonies

 Evidence the brain does not always use symbols 

If the human brain does not use symbolic reasoning to create intelligent behavior then the necessary side of the hypothesis is false and human intelligence is the counterexample 

 Dreyfus 

Hubert Dreyfus attacked the necessary condition of the physical symbol system hypothesis calling it "the psychological assumption" and defining it thus:
 The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules
Dreyfus refuted this by showing that human intelligence and expertise depended primarily on unconscious instincts rather than conscious symbolic manipulation Experts solve problems quickly by using their intuitions rather than stepbystep trial and error searches Dreyfus argued that these unconscious skills would never be captured in formal rules

 Tversky and Kahnemann 



 Embodied cognition 


George Lakoff Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)
 Evidence that symbolic AI cant efficiently generate intelligence for all problems 

It is impossible to prove that symbolic AI will never produce general intelligence but if we can not find an efficient way to solve particular problems with symbolic AI this is evidence that the sufficient side of the PSSH is unlikely to be true 

 Intractability 



 Common sense knowledge frame qualification and ramification problems 


 Moravecs paradox  



 Evidence that subsymbolic or neurosymbolic AI programs can generate intelligence 
If subsymbolic AI programs such as deep learning can intelligently solve problems then this is evidence that the necessary side of the PSSH is false 

If hybrid approaches that combine symbolic AI with other approaches can efficiently solve a wider range of problems than either technique alone this is evidence that the necessary side is true and the sufficiency side is false 

 Brooks 

Rodney Brooks of MIT was able to build robots that had superior ability to move and survive without the use of symbolic reasoning at all Brooks (and others such as Hans Moravec) discovered that our most basic skills of motion survival perception balance and so on did not seem to require highlevel symbols at all that in fact the use of highlevel symbols was more complicated and less successful

In a 1990 paper http://peoplecsailmitedu/brooks/papers/elephantspdf Elephants Dont Play Chess robotics researcher Rodney Brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis arguing that symbols are not always necessary since "the world is its own best model It is always exactly up to date It always has every detail there is to be known The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough"

 Connectionism and deep learning 
In 2012 AlexNet a deep learning network outperformed all other programs in classifying images on ImageNet by a substantial margin In the years since deep learning has proved to be much more successful in many domains than symbolic AI
