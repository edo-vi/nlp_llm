A wellbird exam is a checkup for birds which are assumed to be healthy These examinations are frequently performed by an avian veterinarian when the bird is first acquired and annually thereafter

The examination
The veterinarian will likely ask the owner about the birds housing diet and activities then examine the birds feathers eyes ears and nares for signs of illness He or she will probably acquire a Grams stain and may also clip the birds wings and toenails if requested He or she will likely offer advice about caring for the pet

Importance
Birds often hide their illnesses very well and an avian veterinarian may see symptoms of illness that are not observable to the untrained eye Periodic examination serves as a baseline for comparison for future reference If an examined bird ever becomes sick and requires the care of a veterinarian he or she will already have much data about the birds weight (one of the earliest indicators of illness in birds) diet and care
