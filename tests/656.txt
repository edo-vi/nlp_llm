Human presence in space is about humanity in space particularly about all anthropogenic presence in space and human activity in space that is in outer space and in a broader sense also on any wikt:extraterrestrial
Humans have been present in space either in the common sense through their direct presence and activity like human spaceflight or through mediation of their presence and activity like with uncrewed spaceflight making "telepresence" possible Human presence in space particularly through mediation can take many physical forms from space debris uncrewed spacecraft artificial satellites space observatories crewed spacecraft Space artArt in space
Humans have achieved some mediated presence throughout the Solar System but the most extensive presence has been in Geocentric orbit
Securing the access to space and human presence in space has been pursued and allowed by the establishment of space law and space industry creating a space infrastructure But sustainability has remained a challenging goal with the United Nations seeing the need to advance longterm Space sustainability
 Terminology 
The United States has been using the term "human presence" to identify one of the longterm goals of its space program and its international cooperation While it traditionally means and is used to name direct human presence it is also used for mediated presence Differentiating human presence in space between direct and mediated human presence meaning human or nonhuman presence such as with crewed spacecraft
Human particularly direct presence in space is sometimes replaced with "boots on the ground" and even Settler colonialism
Alternatively some have used the term "humanization of space" which differs in focusing on the general development impact and structure of human presence in space

On an international level the United Nations uses the phrase of "outer space activity" for the activity of its member states in space

 History 



Human presence in space that is in outer space above Earths atmosphere began with the first launches of artificial objects into outer space in the mid 20th century

Since then the activity and presence in outer space has increased to the point where Earth is orbited by a vast number of artificial objects and the far reaches of the Solar System have been visited and explored by a range of space probes Human presence throughout the Solar System is continued by different contemporary and future missions most of them mediating human presence through robotic spaceflight

First a realized project of the Soviet Union and followed in competition by the United States human presence in space is now an increasingly international and commercial use of space
 Representation and participation 

Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue of human access to and presence in space ever since the beginning of spaceflight Different space agency
Some rights of nonspacefaring countries to partake in spaceflight have been secured through international space law declaring space the "Common heritage of mankind
Additionally to international inclusion the Women in space
 Law and governance

Space activity is legally based on the Outer Space Treaty the main international treaty Though there are other international agreements such as the significantly less ratified Moon Treaty

The Outer Space Treaty established the basic ramifications for space activity in article one:
"The exploration and use of outer space including the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development and shall be the province of all mankind"

And continued in article two by stating:
"Outer space including the Moon and other celestial bodies is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty by means of use or occupation or by any other means"

The development of international space law has revolved much around outer space being defined as common heritage of mankind The Magna Carta of Space presented by William A Hyman in 1966 framed outer space explicitly  not as terra nullius but as res communis which subsequently influenced the work of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS)

The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs and the International Telecommunication Union are international organizations central for facilitating space regulation such as space traffic management

 Forms 
 Signals and radiation 
File:Starlink Satellites Imaged from CTIOjpegHumans have been producing a range of radiation which has reached space unintentionally as well as intentionally well before any direct human presence in space
Electromagnetic radiation such as light of humans has been reaching even stars as far away as the age of the radiation

Beginning in the 20th century humans have been sending radiation significantly into space Nuclear explosions especially highaltitude nuclear explosion
While Earths and humanities radiation profile is the main material for Earth observation satellite
 Space junk and human impact 



File:LEOSpaceDebrisNov2020png
Space junk as product and form of human presence in space has existed ever since the first orbital spaceflights and comes mostly in the form of space debris in outer space Space debris has been for example possibly the first human objects to have been present in space beyond Earth reaching its escape velocity after being ejected purposefully from an exploded Aerobee rocket in 1957 Most space debris is in orbit around Earth it can stay there for years to centuries if at altitudes from hundreds to thousands of kilometers before it falls to Earth Space debris is a hazard since it can hit and damage spacecraft Having reached considerable amounts around Earth policies have been put into place to prevent space debris and hazards such as Nuclear power in spaceRegulation and hazard prevention
But space junk can also come as result of human activity on astronomical bodies such as the remains of space missions like the many List of artificial objects on the Moon

 Robotic 


Human presence in space has been strongly based on the many robotic spacecraft particularly as the many artificial satellites in orbit around Earth

Many firsts of human presence in space have been achieved by robotic missions The first artificial object to reach space above the 100&nbsp;km altitude Kármán line and therefore performing the first suborbital flight was MW 18014 in 1944 But the first sustained presence in space was established by the orbital flight of Sputnik in 1957 Followed by a rich number of robotic space probes achieving human presence and exploration throughout the Solar system for the first time

Human presence at the Moon was established by the Luna programme starting in 1959 with despite loosing contact a first Flyby (spaceflight)Interplanetary spaceflight

The 1958 Vanguard 1 is the fourth artificial satellite and the oldest spacecraft still in space and orbit around Earth though inactive

 Presence of nonhuman life from Earth 


File:Posta Romana  1959  Laika 120 Bjpg
Since the very beginning of human outer space activities in 1944 and Panspermia
Visits of organisms to extraterrestrial bodies have been a significant issue of planetary protection as with the Tardigrades on the Moon
Plants first grown in 1966 with Kosmos 110 and in 1971 on Salyut 1 with the first producing seeds August 4 1982 on Salyut 7 The first plant to sprout on the Moon and any extraterrestrial body grew in 2019 on the Change 4 lander

Plants and growing them in space and places such as the Moon have been important subjects of space research but also as psychological support and possibly nutrition during continuous crewed presence in space

 Direct human presence in space 

File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISSjpgDirect human presence in space was achieved with Yuri Gagarin flying a space capsule in 1961 for one orbit around Earth for the first time While direct human presence in open space by exiting a spacecraft in a spacesuit a socalled extravehicular activity has been achieved since the first person to do so Alexei Leonov in 1965

Though Valentina Tereshkova was in 1963 the first woman in space women saw no further presence in space until the 1980s and are still underrepresented eg with no women ever being present on the Moon An internationalization of direct human presence in space started with the first space rendezvous of two crews of different human spaceflight programs the Apollo–Soyuz mission in 1975 and at the end of the 1970s with the Interkosmos program

Space stations have harboured so far the only longduration direct human presence in space After the first station Salyut 1 (1971) and its tragic Soyuz 11 crew space stations have been operated consecutively since Skylab (1973) having allowed a progression of longduration direct human presence in space Longduration direct human presence has been joined by visiting crews since 1977 (Salyut 6) Consecutive direct human presence in space has been achieved since the Salyut programAt times the number of people present in space at the same time has climbed since 1995 above 13 with a record 17 in 2023 on two space stations The ISS has hosted the most people in space at the same time reaching 13 for the first time during the eleven day docking of STS127 in 2009

File:STS131 & Expedition 23 Group Portraitjpg
Beyond Earth the Moon has been the only astronomical object which so far has seen direct human presence through the week long Apollo program
While most persons who have been to space are Astronauts professional members of human spaceflight programs particularly governmental ones the few others starting in the 1980s have been trained and gone to space as spaceflight participants with the first space tourist staying in space in 2001

By the end of the 2010s several hundred people from more than Timeline of space travel by nationalitySpace travelers have spent by 2007 over 29000 persondays (or a cumulative total of over 77 years) in space including over 100 persondays of spacewalks
Usual durations for individuals to inhabit space on longduration stays are six months with the Timeline of longest spaceflights



 Space infrastructure 


A permanent human presence in space depends on an established space infrastructure which harbours supplies and maintains human presence Such infrastructure has originally been Earth Ground segment
Space stations are space habitat (facility)The planned Artemis program includes the Lunar Gateway a future space station around the Moon as a multimission waystation



 Spiritual and artistic 

File:Fallen AstronautjpgHuman presence has also been expressed through spiritual and artistic installations in outer space or MoonHuman impactApollo 15 Mission Commander David Scott left for example a Bible on their Lunar rover during an extravehicular activity on the Moon Space has furthermore been the sight of people taking part in religious festivities such as Christmas on the International Space Station

 Impact environmental protection and sustainability 



Human space activity and its subsequent presence can and has been having an impact on space as well as on the capacity to access it This impact of human space activity and presence or its potential has created the need to address its issues regarding planetary protection space debris Nuclear power in spaceRegulation and hazard prevention
Space sustainability
Human presence in space is particularly being felt in orbit around Earth The orbital space around Earth has seen increasing and extensive human presence beside its benefits it has also produced a threat to it by carrying with it space debris potentially cascading into the socalled Kessler syndrome This has raised the need for Space traffic management
 Study and reception 


Individually or as a society humans have engaged since prehistory in developing their perception of space above the ground or the Cosmology
Social sciences have been studying such works of people from prehistory to the contemporary with the fields of archaeoastronomy to cultural astronomy With actual human activity and presence in space the need for fields like astrosociology and space archaeology have been added

 Human presence observed from space 


File:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531jpg
Earth observation has been one of the first missions of spaceflight resulting in a dense contemporary presence of Earth observation satellites having a wealth of uses and benefits for life on Earth

Viewing human presence from space particularly by humans directly has been reported by some astronauts to cause a cognitive shift in perception especially while viewing the Earth from outer space this effect has been called the overview effect

 Observation of space from space 


Parallel to the above overview effect the term "ultraview effect" has been introduced for a subjective response of intense awe some astronauts have experienced viewing large "starfields" while in space

Space observatory
 Direct and mediated human presence 


Related to the long discussion of what human presence constitutes and how it should be lived the discussion about direct (eg crewed spacecraft
The relevance of this issue for space policy has risen with the advancement and resulting possibilities of telerobotics to the point where most of the human presence in space has been reallized robotically leaving direct human presence behind

 Localization in space 


The location of human presence has been studied throughout history by astronomy and was significant in order to relate to the heavens that is to outer space and its bodies

The historic argument between geocentrism and heliocentrism is one example about the location of human presence



 Scenarios of and relations to space beyond human presence 


Realizations of the Location of Earth
A diverse range of arguments of how to relate to space beyond human presence have been raised with some seeing space beyond humans as reason to venture out into space and exploring it some aiming for first contact (anthropology)
Considerations about the ecological integrity and independence of celestial bodies counter exploitive understandings of space as dead particularly in the sense of terra nullius have raised issues such as rights of nature

 Purposes and uses 


Space and human presence in it has been the subject of different agendas

Human presence in space at its beginnings was fueled by the Cold War and its outgrowing the Space Race During this time space technology
With the waning of the Space Race concluded by Apollo–Soyuz
Since human activity and presence in space has been producing Benefits of space exploration
With the contemporary socalled NewSpace the aim of commercialization of space has grown along with a narrative of space habitation for the Space and survival
