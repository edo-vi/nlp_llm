Chinese historiography is the study of the techniques and sources used by historians to develop the recorded Chinese history
Overview of Chinese history

The recording of events in Chinese history dates back to the Shang dynasty ( 1600–1046 BC) Many written examples survive of ceremonial inscriptions divinations and records of family names which were carved or painted onto Oracle bones
</ref><ref>Falkenhausen disputes this characterisation noting how historical events are subsumed into religious framework concluding that historiography was not likely the intent of the text while noting that antecedents may have existed which have not survived  cite journal 
</ref> This and thousands of other Chinese bronze inscriptions form our primary sources for the period in which they were interred in elite burials

The oldest surviving history texts of China were compiled in the Book of Documents (Shujing) The Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu) the official chronicle of the State of Lu cover the period from 722 to 481 BC and are among the earliest surviving Chinese historical texts to be arranged as annals The compilations of both of these works are traditionally ascribed to Confucius The Zuo zhuan attributed to Zuo Qiuming in the 5th century BC is the earliest Chinese work of narrative history and covers the period from 722 to 468 BC The anonymous Zhan Guo Ce was a renowned ancient Chinese historical work composed of sporadic materials on the Warring States period between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC

The first systematic Chinese historical text the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) was written by Sima Qian (145 or 135–86BC) based on work by his father Sima Tan during the Han Dynasty It covers the period from the time of the Yellow Emperor until the authors own lifetime Two instances of systematic bookburning and a palace fire in the preceding centuries narrowed the sources available for this work<ref> cite journal

</ref> Because of this highly praised and frequently copied work Sima Qian is often regarded as the father of Chinese historiography The TwentyFour Histories the official histories of the dynasties considered legitimate by imperial Chinese historians all copied Sima Qians format Typically rulers initiating a new dynasty would employ scholars to compile a final history from the records of the previous one using a broad variety of sources

Around the turn of the millennium father–son imperial librarians Liu Xiang (scholar)</ref> In 190 the imperial capital was again destroyed by arson causing the loss of significant amounts of historical material

The Shitong was the first Chinese work about historiography It was compiled by Liu Zhiji between 708 and 710 AD The book describes the general pattern of the official dynastic histories with regard to the structure method arrangement sequence caption and commentary dating back to the Warring States period

The Zizhi Tongjian was a pioneering reference work of Chinese historiography Emperor Yingzong of Song ordered Sima Guang and other scholars to begin compiling this universal history of China in 1065 and they presented it to his successor Emperor Shenzong of Song
Toward the end of the Qing dynasty in the early 20th century scholars looked to Japan and the West for models In the late 1890s although deeply learned in the traditional forms Liang Qichao began to publish extensive and influential studies and polemics that converted young readers to a new type of historiography that Liang regarded as more scientific Liu Yizheng published several specialized history works including History of Chinese Culture This next generation became professional historians training and teaching in universities They included Chang Chiyun Gu Jiegang Fu Sinian and Tsiang Tingfu who were PhDs from Columbia University; and Chen Yinke who conducted his investigations into medieval Chinese history in both Europe and the United States Other historians such as Qian Mu who was trained largely through independent study were more conservative but remained innovative in their response to world trends In the 1920s wideranging scholars such as Guo Moruo adapted Marxism in order to portray China as a nation among nations rather than having an exotic and isolated history The ensuing years saw historians such as Wu Han (historian)
Key organizing concepts

Dynastic cycle


Like the Threeage systemThe Metallic Ages of Hesiod
Unlike Hesiods system however the Duke of Zhous idea of the Mandate of Heaven as a rationale for dethroning the supposedly divine Zi (surname)
This teleology
Multiethnic history
As early as the 1930s the American scholar Owen Lattimore argued that China was the product of the interaction of farming and pastoral societies rather than simply the expansion of the Han Chinese
Both the Taiwan
The acceptance of this view by ethnic minorities sometimes depends on their views on presentday issues The 14th Dalai Lama long insistent on Tibets history being separate from that of China conceded in 2005 that Tibet "is a part of" Chinas "5000year history" as part of a new proposal for Tibetan autonomy Korean nationalism
The Jin dynasty (266–420)
Recent Western scholars have reacted against the ethnically inclusive narrative in Communistsponsored history by writing Historical revisionism 
Marxism

Most Chinese history that is published in the Peoples Republic of China is based on a Marxist historiography Slavery Feudalism Capitalist society
 Socialism The world communist society

The official historical view within the Peoples Republic of China associates each of these stages with a particular era in Chinese history
 Slave society – Xia dynasty Feudal society (decentralized) – Zhou dynasty Feudal society (bureaucratic) – Tang dynasty Feudal society (semicolonial) – First Opium War to end of Qing dynasty
 Capitalist society – History of the Republic of China Socialist society – Peoples Republic of China
Because of the strength of the Chinese Communist Party and the importance of the Marxist interpretation of history in legitimizing its rule it was for many years difficult for historians within the PRC to actively argue in favor of nonMarxist and antiMarxist interpretations of history  However this political restriction is less confining than it may first appear in that the Marxist historical framework is surprisingly flexible and it is a rather simple matter to modify an alternative historical theory to use language that at least does not challenge the Marxist interpretation of history

Partly because of the interest of Mao Zedong historians in the 1950s took a special interest in the role of list of rebellions in China
There are several problems associated with imposing Marxs Europeanbased framework on Chinese history First slavery existed throughout Chinas history but never as the primary form of labor  While the Zhou dynasty
The Japanese scholar Tanigawa Michio writing in the 1970s and 1980s set out to revise the generally Marxist views of China prevalent in Postoccupation Japan
There was a gradual relaxation of Marxist interpretation after the Death and state funeral of Mao Zedong
Modernization
This view of Chinese history sees Chinese society as a traditional society needing to become modern usually with the implicit assumption of Western society as the model Such a view was common amongst European and American historians during the 19th and early 20th centuries but is now criticized for being a Eurocentrism
By the mid20th century it was increasingly clear to historians that the notion of "changeless China" was untenable  A new concept popularized by John King Fairbank
Nonetheless studies seeing Chinas interaction with Europe as the driving force behind its recent history are still common Such studies may consider the First Opium War as the starting point for Chinas modern period Examples include the works of Hosea Ballou Morse
In the 1950s several of Fairbanks students argued that Confucianism was incompatible with modernity Joseph Levenson and Mary C Wright and Albert Feuerwerker argued in effect that traditional Chinese values were a barrier to modernity and would have to be abandoned before China could make progress Wright concluded "The failure of the Tongzhi Restoration
In a different view of modernization the Japanese historian Naito Torajiro argued that China reached modernity during its MidImperial China
Hydraulic despotism

With ideas derived from Marx and Max Weber Karl August Wittfogel argued that bureaucracy arose to manage Irrigation
When Wittfogel published his Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power critics pointed out that water management was given the high status China accorded to officials concerned with taxes rituals or fighting off bandits The theory also has a strong oriental studies
While Wittfogels theories were not popular among Marxist historians in China the economist Ji Chaoding
Convergence
Convergence theory including Hu Shih and Ray Huangs involution theory holds that the past 150 years have been a period in which Chinese and Western civilization have been in the process of converging into a world civilization Such a view is heavily influenced by modernization theory but in Chinas case it is also strongly influenced by indigenous sources such as the notion of Shijie Datong or "Great Unity"  It has tended to be less popular among more recent historians as postmodern Western historians discount overarching narratives and nationalist Chinese historians feel similar about narratives failing to account for some special or unique characteristics of Chinese culture

Antiimperialism

Closely related are colonial and Antiimperialism
Republican
The schools of thought on the Xinhai Revolution Military unification – 1923 to 1928 (Northern Expedition (1926–1927) Political tutelage – 1928 to 1947
 Constitution of the Republic of China
The most obvious criticism is the nearidentical nature of "political tutelage" and of a "constitutional democracy" consisting only of the oneparty rule until the 1990s Against this Chen Shuibian proposed his own FourStage Theory of the Republic of China
Postmodernism
Postmodern interpretations of Chinese history tend to reject narrative history and instead focus on a small subset of Chinese history particularly the daily lives of ordinary people in particular locations or settings

Longterm political economy
Zooming out from the dynastic cycle but maintaining focus on power dynamics the following general periodization based on the most powerful groups and the ways that power is used has been proposed for Chinese history:<ref> cite journal
</ref>
 The aristocratic settlement state (to  550 BCE)
 Centralization of power with military revolution ( 550 BCE –  25 CE)
 Landowning families competing for central power and integrating the South ( 25 –  755)
 Imperial examination scholarofficials and commercialization ( 755 –  1550)
 Commercial interests with global convergence (since  1550)

Recent trends
From the beginning of Communist rule in 1949 until the 1980s Chinese historical scholarship focused largely on the officially sanctioned Marxist theory of Class conflict
The late 20th century and early 21st century have seen numerous studies of Chinese history that challenge traditional paradigms The field is rapidly evolving with much new scholarship often based on the realization that there is much about Chinese history that is unknown or controversial For example an active topic concerns whether the typical Chinese peasantry
Recent Western scholarship of China has been heavily influenced by postmodernism and has questioned modernist narratives of Chinas backwardness and lack of development The desire to challenge the preconception that 19thcentury China was weak for instance has led to a scholarly interest in Qing expansion into Central Asia Postmodern scholarship largely rejects grand narratives altogether preferring to publish empirical studies on the socioeconomics and political or cultural dynamics of smaller communities within China

As of at least 2023 there has been a surge of historical writing about key leaders of the Nationalist government
Nationalism
In China historical scholarship remains largely Chinese nationalismcite journal
</ref>

After 1911 writers historians and scholars in China and abroad generally deprecated the late imperial system and its failures However in the 21st century a highly favorable revisionism has emerged in the popular culture in both the Mass mediaFlorian Schneider argues that nationalism in China in the early twentyfirst century is largely a product of the digital revolution and that a large fraction of the population participates as readers and commentators who relate ideas to their friends over the internet
