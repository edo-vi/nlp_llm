History
Image:Orfeo libretto dédicacejpgEvidence of dedications is provided back into Classical antiquity Besides the wish to express their gratitude towards a certain person the authors often had also other reasons to dedicate their work to a particular person Well into the 18th century it was not usual for publishers to remunerate the authors; authors tended to be paid or remunerated as one element of a patronclient relationship in which the authorclient paid tribute in the dedication to his or her patron  A typical writer dedicated "their book to a high standing personality – to Fürsts or bishops – or to a city and tried to gain some money through this practice"

In many cases the petitioner was lucky and received a gift from the patron In some cases the writer groveled before the patron and a formal dedication "contained often a very elaborate and submissive affection" In some cases not only the authors tried to get some money but also the printers tried through dedications to cover a part of their costs

Themes
A book dedication can provide a fascinating glimpse into the life and times of the author<ref>cite booklast1Barnes 
Book dedications can reflect the tastes and mores of society Whereas many Elizabethan dedications were erudite and witty some modern authors have abandoned literary pretense sometimes using profanity to shock or amuse their audiences

Book dedications have also been used to make political statements such as the condemnation of war and inequality Author Toni Morrison dedicated Beloved (novel)
Today
In newer books the dedication is located on a "dedication page" on its own usually on the Recto and verso
Today book dedications tend to be short often thanking partners family friends or muses in the form of a personal note They are basically a means to express gratitude Sometimes a book is dedicated to the memory of a loved one or to a cause

Handwritten dedication

The dedication is not to be confounded with the handwritten dedication of a single copy: the presentation copy
