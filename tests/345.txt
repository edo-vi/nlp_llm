The Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating Centre (EPPICentre) is part of the Faculty of Education and Society at University College London Its work is concerned with systematic reviews which use transparent and explicit methodologies for reviewing research evidence in order to be clear about what we know from research and how we know it

 Methods for Research Synthesis 

A major focus of the EPPICentre is the development of methods of systematic reviews including systematic mapping and synthesis The Centre is the Methods for Research Synthesis (MRS) Node of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) National Centre for Research Methods

The Centre has adapted the model of systematic reviews that has been widely developed in healthcare to address a broader range of questions and methodologies relevant to public policy research such as statistical narrative and conceptual synthesis

 Working with a range of users 

The EPPICentres programme of work seeks to develop ways of working with various groups of research and service ‘users’ throughout the review process including deciding which topics need most urgently to be reviewed and analyzing and disseminating the results of reviews  
A particular aim is to explore the perspectives and participation of those people who are or represent people receiving a service or who are affected by the service in some other way This might include: patients in a clinical encounter; students in a classroom; people receiving missing or avoiding health promotion interventions; or students and parents in relation to an education policy

 Evidence Library 

The EPPICentre conducts systematic reviews of research evidence across a range of topics Major areas include education health promotion employment social care and justice
The reviews on these topics can be found in an Online Evidence Library which provides evidence overviews of broad topic areas as well as summaries and full reports of specific reviews conducted or supported by the EPPICentre

 Collaborative Partnerships 


Work at the EPPICentre is funded by a range of research councils  government departments and charities and national and international partners The EPPIcentre has strong links with two international collaborations concerned with policyrelevant reviews of research evidence: the Cochrane Collaboration in health care and the Campbell collaboration for social interventions

 Teaching and Learning 
 
The EPPICentre offers a large programme of training and workshops on methodological and practical aspects of systematic research synthesis including an http://eppiioeacuk/cms/?tabid692 MSc in Research for Public Policy and Practice The Centre offers facetoface and online distance short courses in http://eppiioeacuk/cms/Defaultaspx?tabid694 Systematic reviews for policy and practice; http://eppiioeacuk/cms/Defaultaspx?tabid695 Participative research and policy; and http://eppiioeacuk/cms/Defaultaspx?tabid696 Methods for research synthesis

 EPPIReviewer software 

EPPIReviewer is a web application that enables researchers to manage the entire lifecycle of a review in a single location  Users are able to upload studies for screening complete keywording and data extractions and analyse the results over the internet Analytical functions include metaanalysis summary tables and support for qualitative synthesis
