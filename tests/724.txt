A mode of toxic action is a common set of physiological and behavioral signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response. A mode of action should not be confused with mechanism of action which refer to the biochemical processes underlying a given mode of action. Modes of toxic action are important widely used tools in ecotoxicology and aquatic toxicology because they classify toxicants or pollution
 Types 

 Non-specific 

Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)
 Specific 

Toxicants that at low concentrations modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or molecule have a specific acting mode of toxic action. However at high enough concentrations toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce narcotic
There are several specific acting modes of toxic action:
* Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)* Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. Acetylcholinesterase* Irritants. These are chemicals that cause an inflammation* Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents. Central nervous system* Respiratory blockers. These are toxicants that affect Respiration (physiology)
 Determination 

The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish reason why they named the categories as Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)
It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR). The CBR is the whole-body concentration of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response and it is estimated using a partition coefficient and a bioconcentration factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first approximations of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s). Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism so this Heart rate variability
Scientific modeling
 Applications 

 Environmental risk assessment 

The objective of environmental impact assessment
 Regulation 

The combination of behavioral and physiological responses CBR estimates and chemical fate and bioaccumulation QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool to address pollution and toxicity in areas where effluents are discharged.
