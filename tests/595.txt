The Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition () commonly referred to as the Balmis Expedition was a Spanish healthcare mission that lasted from 1803 to 1806 led by Dr Francisco Javier de Balmis which vaccinated millions of inhabitants of Spanish America and Asia against smallpox The vaccine was actually transported through children: orphaned boys who sailed with the expedition

 Background 
Smallpox a devastating disease that was endemic throughout much of the Old World decimated the populations of the Americas after it was introduced by the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s By the late 16th century smallpox had become endemic throughout Spains holdings in the Americas and epidemics occurred periodically over the next 300 years 

In the 18th century there were scattered attempts in the colonies to use variolation an older lesseffective method of inoculation using smallpox material These efforts did little to mitigate the epidemics and sometimes actually increased the spread of the contagion

In 1798 English physician Edward Jenner pioneered the use of a vaccine to immunize persons with an inoculation of cowpox material The new vaccine was a much safer and more effective way to prevent smallpox At the time about 400000 Europeans died each year from the disease which was also responsible for onethird of all cases of blindness in Europe The use of Jenners new vaccine spread rapidly through Europe and had a significant positive impact on the severity and frequency of smallpox epidemics

The vaccine first reached Spain in late 1800 and by the end of 1801 several thousand persons had been vaccinated across the country The efforts were well publicised in Spain and by 1804 dozens of papers treatises newspaper articles and editorials had been published on the smallpox vaccine

Francisco Javier de Balmis was a military physician

In November 1794 the daughter of King Charles IV of Spain Infanta Maria Teresa had died from smallpox He had heard of the vaccine discovery Colombia and Ecuador experienced a smallpox epidemic and called on the king for supplies

On 30 November 1803 the expedition set off from A Coruña in northwest Spain sailing on Maria Pita It carried 22 orphan boys (aged 3 to 10) to act as carriers of the cowpox virus The boys were necessary because the vaccine consisted of infecting patients with cowpox which is a virus closely related to smallpox but produces a much milder disease that confers immunity to both However only an active infection could be transferred to successive patients so two boys were infected with cowpox at the beginning of the voyage with two more infected at a time as it progressed across the Atlantic and beyond The medical staff and caretakers for the boys consisted of Balmis a deputy surgeon two assistants two firstaid practitioners three nurses and Isabel Zendal
The mission took the vaccine to the Canary Islands Puerto Rico Venezuela Viceroyalty of New Granada
In Puerto Rico the local population had already been inoculated from the Danish colony of Saint Thomas US Virgin Islands
At Balmis’ request Cuba sent three enslaved girls to Campeche Mexico as additional carriers of the vaccine; following Mexican independence and emancipation Mexico continued to bring in slaves from Cuba as vaccine carriers

The Venezuelan poet Andrés Bello wrote an ode to Balmis José Salvany the deputy surgeon went toward todays Colombia and the Viceroyalty of Peru (Ecuador Peru Chile and Bolivia) The voyage took seven years and cost Salvany his life as he died in 1810 in Cochabamba In New Spain Balmis took on 25 more orphans to maintain the infection during the crossing of the Pacific In the Philippines they received help from the Catholic church which was initially reluctant until GovernorGeneral of the Philippines
Legacy
Balmis expedition may be considered the first international healthcare expedition in history Jenner himself wrote "I dont imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble so extensive as this"

In 2006 Julia Alvarez wrote Saving the World a fictional account of the expedition from the perspective of its only female member
