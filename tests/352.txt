A homologous booster shot involves the administration of the same vaccine as previously administered while a heterologous booster shot involves the administration of a different vaccine
<blockquote>"Heterologous primeboost immunization is administration of two different vectors or delivery systems expressing the same or overlapping antigenic inserts"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"An effective vaccine usually requires more than one time immunization in the form of primeboost Traditionally the same vaccines are given multiple times as homologous boosts New findings suggested that primeboost can be done with different types of vaccines containing the same antigens In many cases such heterologous primeboost can be more immunogenic than homologous primeboost"</blockquote>
