The Migration Period also known as the Barbarian Invasions was a period in History of Europe
The term refers to the important role played by the migration invasion and settlement of various tribes notably the Franks Goths Alemanni Alans Huns early Slavs Pannonian Avars Bulgars and Hungarians
Historians differ as to the dates for the beginning and ending of the Migration Period The beginning of the period is widely regarded as the invasion of Europe by the Huns from Asia in about 375 and the ending with the Kingdom of the Lombards
There are contradictory opinions as to whether the fall of the Western Roman Empire was a result of an increase in migrations or both the breakdown of central power and the increased importance of nonRomans resulted in internal Roman factors Migrations and the use of nonRomans in the military were known in the periods before and after and the Byzantine Empire
The migrants comprised war bands or tribes of 10000 to 20000 people Immigration was common throughout the time of the Roman Empire but over the course of 100 years the migrants numbered not more than 750000 in total compared to an average 40&nbsp;million population of the Roman Empire at that time The first migrations of peoples were made by Germanic peoples
 Chronology 

 Germanic tribes prior to migration 


Germanic peoples moved out of southern Scandinavia and northern Germany to the adjacent lands between the Elbe and Oder after 1000&nbsp;BC The first wave moved westward and southward (pushing the resident Celts west to the Rhine around 200&nbsp;BC) moving into southern Germany up to the Roman provinces of Gaul and Cisalpine Gaul by 100&nbsp;BC where they were stopped by Gaius Marius and later by Julius Caesar It is this western group which was described by the Roman historian Tacitus (AD&nbsp;56–117) and Julius Caesar (100–44&nbsp;BC) A later wave of Germanic tribes migrated eastward and southward from Scandinavia between 600 and 300&nbsp;BC to the opposite coast of the Baltic Sea moving up the Vistula near the Carpathian Mountains During Tacitus era they included lesserknown tribes such as the Tencteri Cherusci Hermunduri and Chatti; however a period of federation and intermarriage resulted in the familiar groups known as the Alemanni Franks Saxons Frisians and Thuringii
 First wave

The first wave of invasions between AD&nbsp;300 and 500 is partly documented by Greek and Latin historians but is difficult to verify archaeologically It puts Germanic peoples in control of most areas of what was then the Western Roman Empire

 Barbarian identity 


Analysis of barbarian Cultural identity
The "primordialistic" paradigm prevailed during the 19th century Scholars such as German linguist Johann Gottfried Herder viewed tribes as coherent biological (racial) entities using the term to refer to discrete ethnic groups He also believed that the Volk were an organic whole with a core identity and spirit evident in art literature and language These characteristics were seen as intrinsic unaffected by external influences even conquest Language in particular was seen as the most important expression of ethnicity They argued that groups sharing the same (or similar) language possessed a common identity and ancestry This was the Romanticism
From the 1960s a reinterpretation of archaeological and historical evidence prompted scholars such as Goffart and Todd to propose new models for explaining the construction of barbarian identity They maintained that no sense of shared identity was perceived by the Germani; a similar theory having been proposed for Celtic and Slavic groups

A theory states that the primordialist mode of thinking was encouraged by a prima facie interpretation of GrecoRoman world
The role of language in constructing and maintaining group identity can be ephemeral since largescale language shifts occur commonly in history Modernists propose the idea of "imagined communities"; the barbarian polities in late antiquity were social constructs rather than unchanging lines of blood kinship The process of forming tribal units was called "ethnogenesis" a term coined by Soviet Union
<blockquote>The common trackfilled map of the  may illustrate such a course of events but it misleads Unfolded over long periods of time the changes of position that took place were necessarily irregular&nbsp; (with) periods of emphatic discontinuity For decades and possibly centuries the tradition bearers idled and the tradition itself hibernated There was ample time for forgetfulness to do its work</blockquote>

File:EastHem 100adjpgRather than "invasion" German and Slavic scholars speak of "migration" (see    and ) aspiring to the idea of a dynamic and "wandering IndoEuropean languages
In contrast the standard terms in French and Italian historiography translate to "barbarian invasions" or even "barbaric invasions" ( )

Historians have postulated several explanations for the appearance of "barbarians" on the Roman frontier: climate change weather and crops population pressure a "primeval urge" to push into the Mediterranean the construction of the Great Wall of China causing a "domino effect" of tribes being forced westward leading to the Huns falling upon the Goths who in turn pushed other Germanic tribes before them In general French and Italian scholars have tended to view this as a catastrophic event the destruction of a civilization and the beginning of a "Dark Age" that set Europe back a millennium In contrast German and English historians have tended to see Roman–Barbarian interaction as the replacement of a "tired effete and decadent Mediterranean civilization" with a "more virile martial Nordic one"
File:Barbarian invasions from 3rd centurypngThe scholar Guy Halsall has seen the barbarian movement as the result of the fall of the Roman Empire not its cause Archaeological discoveries have confirmed that Germanic and Slavic tribes were settled agriculturalists who were probably merely "drawn into the politics of an empire already falling apart for quite a few other causes" Goffart argues that the process of settlement was connected to hospitalitas the Roman practice of quartering soldiers among the civilian population The Romans by granting land and the right to levy taxes to allied (Germanic) armies hoped to reduce the financial burdens of the empire The Crisis of the Third Century caused significant changes within the Roman Empire in both its western and its eastern portions In particular economic fragmentation removed many of the political cultural and economic forces that had held the empire together

The rural population in Roman provinces became distanced from the metropolis and there was little to differentiate them from other peasants across the Roman frontier In addition Rome increasingly used foreign mercenaries to defend itself That "barbarisation" parallelled changes within Barbaricum To this end noted linguist Dennis Howard Green wrote "the first centuries of our era witness not merely a progressive Romanisation of barbarian society but also an undeniable barbarisation of the Roman world" 

For example the Roman Empire played a vital role in building up barbarian groups along its frontier Propped up with imperial support and gifts the armies of allied barbarian chieftains served as buffers against other hostile barbarian groups The disintegration of Roman economic power weakened groups that had come to depend on Roman gifts for the maintenance of their own power The arrival of the Huns helped prompt many groups to invade the provinces for economic reasons

File:Europe and the Near East at 476 ADpngThe nature of the barbarian takeover of former Roman provinces varied from region to region For example in Aquitaine the provincial administration was largely selfreliant Halsall has argued that local rulers simply "handed over" military rule to the Ostrogoths acquiring the identity of the newcomers In Gaul the collapse of imperial rule resulted in anarchy: the Franks and Alamanni
Halsall and Noble have argued that such changes stemmed from the breakdown in Roman political control which exposed the weakness of local Roman rule Instead of largescale migrations there were military takeovers by small groups of warriors and their families who usually numbered only in the tens of thousands The process involved active conscious decisionmaking by Roman provincial populations

The collapse of centralized control severely weakened the sense of Roman identity in the provinces which may explain why the provinces then underwent dramatic cultural changes even though few barbarians settled in them Ultimately the Germanic groups in the Western Roman Empire were accommodated without "dispossessing or overturning indigenous society" and they maintained a structured and hierarchical (but attenuated) form of Roman administration

Ironically they lost their unique identity as a result of such an  accommodation and were absorbed into Latinhood In contrast in the east Slavic tribes maintained a more "spartan and egalitarian" existence bound to the land "even in times when they took their part in plundering Roman provinces" Their organizational models were not Roman and their leaders were not normally dependent on Roman gold for success Thus they arguably had a greater effect on their region than the Goths the Franks or the Saxons had on theirs

 Ethnicity 
Based on the belief that particular types of artifacts elements of personal adornment generally found in a funerary context are thought to indicate the ethnicity of the person buried the "CultureHistory" school of archaeology assumed that archaeological cultures represent the  (homeland) of tribal polities named in historical sources As a consequence the shifting extensions of material cultures were interpreted as the expansion of peoples
