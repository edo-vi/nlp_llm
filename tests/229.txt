Aerial photograph interpretation is also useful to assess the risk of landslides and other dangers in the natural environment in the Geotechnical engineeringâ€Œ</ref> As proper interpretation of aerial photos can reveal historical changes of the topography and the details of previous landslides it can be help determine whether an area is stable or not Geologists can further utilize the interpretations to design the most favorable locations for Field research
 Geologic applications of aerial photographs 

 Landslide hazard assessment 
Aerial photographs play an important role in assessing the risk of different natural hazards particularly landslides They can be used to determine whether hillslopes are stable or not They can also record the history of landslides experienced in that area For example in an area with more than half of the ground surface constitutes Natural environment
A landslide scar refers to the local area disrupted by the landslide It comprises the starting point also called the "source" the detached substances and a trail that describes the movement of a landslide Every landslide scar is noted along with its position size and the estimated date of the event For the current landslides in the photograph they can be recognized easily by the unique lightcolored landslide scar Very few plants can be observed on the scar For historical or old landslides they may be hidden by vegetation such as bushes and woody plants but scars in the land are still present This type of landslide is recognized by a concave Depression (geology)File:Landslides from hkpng
 Determining geological structures and types of rock 
Aerial photographs can be used to identify different rock types on the rock exposure and the arrangement of the geological structures These structures are produced by Deformation (physics)
For example in Hong Kong the two major rocks are granite (35%) and volcanic rock (50%) Since granite is more easily weathered and eroded than volcanic rocks it usually forms gullies which are the valleys on a smaller scale whereas volcanic rocks form the summit which is the location with a higher elevation in the mountains 
File:Example of determing geological structurespngAnother example of determining geological structures is a fold found in Wyoming in the United States A fold is developed when the rock layers are squeezed and curved by forces and do not break during the deformation It is an anticline which has the earliestformed rock layers in the inner part and the youngest rock layer on the outer part of the fold The Fold (geology)File:Fold terminology01jpg
 Boulder survey 
Boulder surveys determine and categorize the areas of boulders using aerial photograph interpretation After the survey the properties (dimension amount form) of boulders are combined with the geological map This helps detect dangers from the Rockfall
Dense forests may obstruct the view of boulders from aerial photographs which is one of the limitations of using aerial photographs to conduct a boulder survey Therefore old aerial photographs with less vegetation are usually more beneficial for boulder mapping Hillslopes are often occupied by some small village houses which produce a shadow These factors may decrease the efficiency of the boulder survey whereas bare ground allows for typically good sight of the terrain File:A sketch map from the boulder surveyjpg
 Studying landforms 
Aerial photographs can be used to help study recognize and classify landforms which refers to the topographical characteristics created by the Environment (systems)File:Landform studies 2png
 Regolith mapping 
Regolith mapping helps distinguish different kinds of superficial deposits which refer to loosely arranged Aggregate (geology)
 Valley colluvium 
Valley colluvium refers to the loose Soil consolidation

 Agricultural terraces 
Regolith mapping can also be used to determine disrupted natural landscapes in aerial photographs For example Terrace (earthworks)File:Collina di Montevecchia fianco jpg
