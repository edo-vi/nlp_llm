Futile medical care is the continued provision of medical care or treatment to a patient when there is no reasonable hope of a cure or benefit

Some proponents of evidencebased medicine suggest discontinuing the use of any treatment that has not been shown to provide a measurable benefit Futile care discontinuation is distinct from euthanasia because euthanasia involves active intervention to end life while withholding futile medical care does not encourage or hasten the natural onset of death

 Definition 
In the broadest sense futile care is care that does not benefit the patient as a whole including physical spiritual or other benefits This may be interpreted differently in various legal ethical or religious contexts Clinicians and health care providers may need to rely on a more narrow definition of futile care in order to make decisions about a patients health care and this definition often centers around an assessment of the likelihood that a patient could physically recover as a result of treatment or the likelihood of such treatment to relieve a patients suffering Examples of futile care may be a surgeon operating on a terminal cancer patient even when the surgery will not alleviate suffering; or doctors keeping a braindead person on lifesupport machines for reasons other than to procure their organs for donation It is a sensitive area that often causes conflicts among medical practitioners and patients or kin

Many controversies surrounding the concept of futile care center around how futility is assessed differently in specific situations rather than on arguments in favor of providing futile care per se It is difficult to determine when a particular course of action may fall under the definition of futile medical care because of the difficulty in defining the point at which there is no further benefit to intervention in each case For instance a cancer patient may be willing to undergo yet more chemotherapy with a very expensive medication for the benefit of a few weeks of life while medical staff insurance company staff and close relatives may believe this is a futile course of care

A 2010 survey of more than 10000 physicians in the United States found respondents divided on the issue of recommending or giving "lifesustaining therapy when they judged that it was futile" with 236% saying they would do so 37% saying they would not and 394% selecting "It depends"

Arguments against providing futile medical care

Arguments against providing futile care include potential harm to patients family members or caregivers with little or no likely benefits and the diversion of resources to support the futile care of patients when resources could be used to provide care to patients that could respond to care

Futile care does not offer benefits to the patient as a whole and at the same time the physical emotional spiritual economic or ethical hardship and harm caused by futile care to the patient or to family members may be significant

While futile care does not benefit patients it may cost providers the state and patient families significant money and resources In some cases futile care involves the expenditure of resources that could be used by other patients with a good likelihood of achieving a positive outcome For instance in the case of Baby K attempts to transfer the infant to other centers were unsuccessful because there were no unoccupied pediatrics
Issues in futile care considerations

The issue of futile care in clinical medicine generally involves two questions The first concerns the identification of those clinical scenarios where the care would be futile The second concerns the range of ethical options when care is determined to be futile

Assessment of futility in a clinical context
Clinical scenarios vary in degrees and manners of futility While scenarios like providing ICU care to the braindead patient or the Anencephaly
A study in the United Kingdom with more than 180000 patients aimed to define a timeframe for quantitative futility in emergency laparotomy and investigate predictors of futility using the United Kingdom National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) database A twostage methodology was used; stage one defined a timeframe for futility using an online survey and steering group discussion; stage two applied this definition to patients enrolled in NELA December 2013â€“December 2020 for analysis Futility was defined as allcause mortality within 3 days of emergency laparotomy Results showed that quantitative futility occurred in 4% of patients (7442/180987) and median age was 74 years Significant predictors of futility included age arterial lactate and cardiorespiratory comorbidity Frailty was associated with a 38% increased risk of early mortality and surgery for intestinal ischaemia was associated with a two times greater chance of futile surgery These findings suggest that quantitative futility after emergency laparotomy is associated with quantifiable risk factors available to decisionmakers preoperatively and should be incorporated into shared decisionmaking discussions with extremely highrisk patients

Over the last four decades the clinical community has improved the quality of prognosis
These prognostic algorithms estimate the probability of the patient surviving In a study of patients so severely burned that survival was clinically unprecedented during the initial lucid period (before sepsis and other complications set in) patients were told that survival was extremely unlikely (ie that death was essentially inevitable) and were asked to choose between palliative care and aggressive clinical measures Most chose aggressive clinical measures which may suggest that the will to live in patients can be very strong even situations deemed hopeless by the clinician

Another practical clinical example that often occurs in large hospitals is the decision about whether or not to continue resuscitation when the resuscitation efforts following an inhospital cardiac arrest have been prolonged A 1999 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has validated an algorithm developed for these purposes

As medical care improves and affects more and more chronic conditions questions of futility have continued to arise A relatively recent response to this difficulty in the United States is the introduction of the hospice concept in which palliative care is initiated for someone thought to be within about six months of death Numerous social and practical barriers exist that complicate the issue of initiating hospice status for someone unlikely to recover

Options for futile care and futile care as a commodity 

Another issue in futile care theory concerns the range of ethical options when care is determined to be futile Some people argue that futile clinical care should be a market commodity that should be able to be purchased just like cruise vacations or luxury automobiles as long as the purchaser of the clinical services has the necessary funds and as long as other patients are not being denied access to clinical resources as a result In this model Baby K would be able to get ICU care (primarily ventilatory care) until funding vanished With rising medical care costs and an increase in extremely expensive new anticancer medications the similar issues of equity often arise in treatment of endstage cancer
