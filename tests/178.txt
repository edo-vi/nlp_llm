Sociobiology is a field of biology that aims to examine and explain social behavior in terms of evolution. It draws from disciplines including psychology ethology anthropology evolution zoology archaeology and population genetics. Within the study of human society
Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as mating system
While the term "sociobiology" originated at least as early as the 1940s; the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of E. O. Wilsons book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis in 1975. The new field quickly became the subject of scientific controversy
Definition

E. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization".

Sociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by natural selection. It begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily successful over time. This can among other things result in the formation of complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.

The discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection. Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve ones genes in the population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be Heredity
For example newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This adaptive behavior
History

The philosopher of biology Daniel Dennett suggested that the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes was the first proto-sociobiologist arguing that in his 1651 book Leviathan (Hobbes book)
The geneticist of animal behavior John Paul Scott (geneticist)Wilsons sociobiology is different from John Paul Scott (geneticist)
Once a specialist term "sociobiology" became widely known in 1975 when Wilson published his book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis which sparked an intense controversy. Since then "sociobiology" has largely been equated with Wilsons vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as altruism aggression and nurturance primarily in ants (Wilsons own research specialty) and other Hymenoptera but also in other animals. However the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself. Peter Kropotkins Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution written in the early 1890s is a popular example. The final chapter of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior and Wilson later wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning book On Human Nature that addressed human behavior specifically.

Edward H. Hagen writes in The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology that sociobiology is despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century." "Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists.
" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the worlds top scientific journals such as Nature (journal)
Theory

Sociobiologists maintain that Human nature
Natural selection is fundamental to evolutionary theory. Variants of hereditary traits which increase an organisms ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations i.e. they will be "selected for". Thus inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an organism a greater chance of surviving and/or reproducing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms. That inherited adaptive behaviors are present in nonhuman Species

Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:
* Certain behavioral traits are inherited
* Inherited behavioral traits have been honed by natural selection. Therefore these traits were probably "adaptive" in the environment in which the species evolved.

Sociobiology uses Nikolaas Tinbergens Tinbergens four questions * the function (i.e. adaptation) that a behavior serves and
* the evolutionary process (i.e. phylogeny) that resulted in this functionality.
The individual-level categories (often called "proximate explanations") are
* the development of the individual (i.e. ontogeny) and
* the proximate mechanism (e.g. brain anatomy and hormones).

Sociobiologists are interested in how behavior can be explained logically as a result of selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus they are often interested in instinctive or Intuition (knowledge) 
Individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a result of gene-centred selection. E.O. Wilson argued that evolution may also act upon social group 
Within sociobiology a social behavior is first explained as a sociobiological hypothesis by finding an evolutionarily stable strategy that matches the observed behavior. Stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove but usually it will predict gene frequencies. The hypothesis can be supported by establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the strategy and those expressed in a population.

Altruism between social insects and littermates has been explained in such a way. Altruistic behavior behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the altruist in some animals has been correlated to the degree of genome shared between altruistic individuals. A quantitative description of infanticide by male harem-mating animals when the alpha male is displaced as well as rodent female infanticide and fetal resorption are active areas of study. In general females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the food and protection from mates.

An important concept in sociobiology is that temperament traits exist in an ecological balance. Just as an expansion of a sheep population might encourage the expansion of a wolf population an expansion of altruistic traits within a gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent traits.

Studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such as creativity extroversion aggressiveness and Intelligence quotient 
Various theorists have argued that in some environments Crime 
Support for premise
Genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behaviour. For example the transcription factor FEV (aka Pet1) through its role in maintaining the Serotonin
A genetic basis for instinctive behavioural traits among non-human species such as in the above example is commonly accepted among many biologists; however attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviours in human societies has remained extremely controversial.

Reception

Steven Pinker argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of biological determinism accusing among others Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin of being "radical scientists" whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science while Lewontin Steven Rose and Leon Kamin who drew a distinction between the politics and history of an idea and its scientific validity argue that sociobiology fails on scientific grounds. Gould grouped sociobiology with eugenics criticizing both in his book The Mismeasure of Man.

Noam Chomsky has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a 1976 meeting of the Sociobiology Study Group as reported by Ullica Segerstråle Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed notion of human nature. Chomsky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such with his criticism of the "blank slate" doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of Steven Pinkers and others work in evolutionary psychology) in his 1975 Reflections on Language. Chomsky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a discussion of Peter Kropotkins Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution which focused more on altruism than aggression suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.

Wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what ought to be only what is the case. However some critics have argued that the language of sociobiology readily slips from "is" to "ought" The history of this debate and others related to it are covered in detail by   and .
