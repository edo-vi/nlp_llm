 History 
"If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day Id say it is Dataism" wrote David Brooks (cultural commentator)
In 2015 Steve Lohrs book Dataism looked at how Big Data is transforming society using the term to describe the Big Data revolution

In his 2016 book Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow Yuval Noah Harari argues that all competing political or social structures can be seen as data processing systems: "Dataism declares that the universe consists of data flows and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing" and "we may interpret the entire human species as a single data processing system with individual humans serving as its chips" According to Harari a Dataist should want to "maximise dataflow by connecting to more and more media" Harari predicts that the logical conclusion of this process is that eventually humans will give algorithms the authority to make the most important decisions in their lives such as whom to marry and which career to pursue Harari argues that Aaron Swartz could be called the "first martyr" of Dataism

 Criticism 
Commenting on Hararis characterisation of Dataism security analyst Daniel Miessler believes that Dataism does not present the challenge to the ideology of liberal humanism that Harari claims because humans will simultaneously be able to believe in their own importance and that of data

Harari himself raises some criticisms such as the problem of consciousness which Dataism is unlikely to illuminate Humans may also find out that organisms are not algorithms he suggests Dataism implies that all data is public even personal data to make the system work as a whole which is a factor thats already showing resistance today

Other analysts such as Terry Ortleib have looked at the extent to which Dataism poses a dystopian threat to humanity

The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal showed how political leaders manipulated Facebooks users data to build specific psychological profiles that went on to manipulate the network A team of data analysts reproduced the AI technology developed by Cambridge Analytica around Facebooks data and was able to define the following rules: 10 likes enables a machine to know a person like a coworker 70 likes like a friend would 150 likes like a parent would 300 likes like a lover would and beyond it may be possible to know a people better than they know themselves
