The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project () was a multidisciplinary project commissioned by the Peoples Republic of China in 1996 to determine with accuracy the location and time frame of the Xia dynasty
The project was directed by professor Li Xueqin of Tsinghua University in Beijing and involved around 200 experts It used radiocarbon dating archaeology

The traditional account of ancient China represented by the Records of the Grand Historian written by Sima Qian in the Han dynasty begins with the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors leading through a sequence of dynasties the Xia dynasty
Many elements of the traditional account especially the early parts were clearly mythical In the 1920s Gu Jiegang and other scholars of the Doubting Antiquity School noted that the earliest figures appeared latest in the literature and suggested that the traditional history had accreted layers of myth  Noting parallels between the accounts of the Xia and Shang they suggested that the history of the Xia was invented by the Zhou to support their doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven by which they justified their conquest of the Shang  Some even doubted the historicity of the Shang dynasty

File:Shang dynasty inscribed scapulajpgIn 1899 the scholar Wang Yirong examined some curious symbols carved on "dragon bones" purchased from a Chinese pharmacist and identified them as an early form of Chinese writing The bones were finally traced back in 1928 to a site (now called Yinxu) near Anyang north of the Yellow River in modern Henan province The inscriptions on the bones were found to be divination records from the reigns of the last nine Shang kings from the reign of Wu Ding Moreover from the sacrificial schedule recorded on the bones it was possible to reconstruct a sequence of Shang kings that closely matched the list given by Sima Qian

Archaeologists focussed on the Yellow River valley in Henan as the most likely site of the states described in the traditional histories After 1950 remnants of an earlier walled city of the Erligang culture were discovered near Zhengzhou and in 1959 the site of the Erlitou culture was found in Yanshi south of the Yellow River near Luoyang  Radiocarbon dating suggests that the Erlitou culture flourished c 2100 BC to 1800 BC They built large palaces suggesting the existence of an organized state More recently the picture has been complicated by the discovery of advanced civilizations in Sichuan and the Yangtze valley such as Sanxingdui and Wucheng culture
Until the mid20th century many popular works both Chinese and Western used a traditional chronology calculated by Liu Xin (scholar)
In 1994 Song Jian a State councillor (China)
A preliminary report of the project was issued in 2000 The full report was published in June 2022 after more than a decade of revision

 Methods 
The Project used a combination of methods to attempt to correlate the traditional literature with archeological discoveries and the astronomical record

 Western Zhou kings 
The contemporary evidence for the Western Zhou consists of thousands of bronzes many bearing inscriptions  Around 60 of these record dates of important events as the day in the sexagenary cycle the phase of the moon the month and the year of reign However the king is usually not identified

Occasionally an unusual astronomical event was recorded A key reference point was the accession of King Yi of Zhou (Jian)The Project adopted (without acknowledgement) the proposal of the Korean scholar Pang Sunjoo (方善柱) that this referred to an annular solar eclipse at dawn that occurred in 899 BC
Other scholars have challenged both this interpretation of the text and the astronomical calculations involved

 King Wus conquest of the Shang 
File:Early Western Zhou Bronze Gui 01jpgFile:Li gui inscriptionjpgPerhaps the most significant event requiring dating is the conquest of the Shang by the Zhou described in traditional histories as the Battle of Muye though the site of the battle has not been identified  Previous chronologies had proposed at least 44 different dates for this event ranging from 1130 to 1018 BC
The most popular have been 1122 BC calculated by the Han dynasty astronomer Liu Xin (scholar)
A few documents relate astronomical observations to this event:
 A quotation in the Book of Han from the lost Wǔchéng 武成 chapter of the Book of Documents appears to describe a lunar eclipse just before the beginning of King Wu of Zhou A passage in the Guoyu (book) The "current text" Bamboo Annals mentions Conjunction (astronomy)
The strategy adopted by the Project was to use archeological investigation to narrow the range of dates that would need to be compared with the astronomical data  Although no archaeological traces of King Wus campaign have been found the preconquest Zhou capital at Fenghao
Other scholars have raised several criticisms of this process The connection between the layers at the archaeological sites and the conquest is uncertain The narrow range of radiocarbon dates are cited with a less stringent confidence interval (68%) than the standard requirement of 95% which would have produced a much wider range The texts describing the relevant astronomical phenomena are extremely obscure For example the inscription on the Li gui
 Late Shang kings 
For the late Shang the oracle bones provide less detail than Zhou bronzes routinely recording only the day in the sexagenary cycle
However calculations using a longer ritual cycle were used to date the reigns of the last two Shang kings Mentions of five lunar eclipses in oracle bone divinations from the late Wu Ding and Zu Geng reigns were identified with events spanning the period from 1201 and 1181 BC from which a start date for Zu Gengs reign was derived The start date of Wu Dings reign was then calculated using the statement in the "Against Luxurious Ease" chapter of the Book of Documents that his reign lasted 59 years

 Early Shang and Xia 
File:Erlitou sites and Xia capitalssvgAccording to the traditional histories Pan Geng three reigns earlier than Wu Ding moved the Shang capital to its last site generally identified with the Yinxu site in Anyang
Different interpretations of the text of the Bamboo Annals give intervals of 275 273 or 253 years between this event and the Zhou conquest
The project settled on a date near the shortest of these intervals

The four phases of the Erlitou culture have been divided between the Xia and Shang dynasties in different ways by various prominent archaeologists
The project assigned all four phases to the Xia identifying the establishment of the Shang dynasty with the building of the Yanshi walled city  northeast of the Erlitou site
The time span of the Xia dynasty was taken from reignlengths given in the Bamboo Annals and from a conjunction of five planets during the reign of Yu the Great recorded in later texts
As this period was longer than the time spanned by the Erlitou culture the project also included the later phases of the Wangwan III variant of the Longshan culture within the Xia period

Chronological table
The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project concluded precise dates for accessions of rulers from Wu Ding the Shang dynasty king whose reign produced the oldest known oracle bone records These dates are here compared with the traditional dates and those used in the Cambridge History of Ancient China:
! rowspan"2" ! rowspan"2" ! colspan"3" ! XSZ Project
! Cambridge History
! Traditional
Earlier dates are given more approximately:
 The relocation of the Shang capital to Yinxu The establishment of the Shang dynasty was identified with the foundation of an Erligang culture walled city at Yanshi dated at c 1600 BC compared with the Cambridge Historys c 1570 BC and the traditional date of 1766 BC
 The establishment of the Xia dynasty was dated at c 2070 BC compared with the traditional date of 2205 BC

Reception

Coverage of the project in nonChinese press focused on the conflict between nationalism and scholarship However not every member of the chronology project agrees on all of the dates Indeed the project has been unafraid to contest dates proposed even by the director This suggests that the dates are being considered on their own merits rather than by deferring to authority and that politics does not influence the detailed work of the project

In addition to methodological concerns scholars have complained that the project is part of a tradition of relegating archaeology to a role of verifying traditional histories  They argue that this forces archeological evidence into a framework of a single sequence of similar dominant states as depicted in the histories and reflected in the title "Three Dynasties"  However when evaluated on its own merits the evidence reveals a much more complex origin of Chinese civilization with many other advanced states that are not mentioned in the histories

A session of the Annual Conference of the Association for Asian Studies in 2002 was devoted to the preliminary report where its methods were criticised by David Nivison among others An international conference on chronology arranged for October 2003 was postponed due to the Severe acute respiratory syndrome
