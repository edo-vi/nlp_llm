 Meaningfulness as a concept

 Word 
For linguists the term word is far from unambiguous It is defined graphically as a set of letters between two Word dividerFile:A dans lABC de RatisbonnejpegFor Françoise Benzécri the bijection seems obvious: "Every letter of an ordinary alphabet is associated with the oneletter word it constitutes noted as that letter" but Darryl Francis notes on the contrary that the meaning of oneletter words is not reduced to designating the letter that constitutes them Solange Cuénod also asserts that a oneletter word "has no reason to be taken as that letter" and gives the following example:

 Letter 
File:Letter t as an ideogrramjpgLetters are the elements of an alphabet ie a writing system based on the representation of sounds as opposed to IdeogramFile:Q paléographique croppedjpgSeveral authors have pointed out that there can be no more oneletter words than there are letters in the alphabet such as Françoise Benzécri for whom there are "as many oneletter words as there are letters" In addition to the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet the French language uses 16 diacritical letters accepted by the civil registry: à â ä ç é è ê ë ï î ô ö ù û ü and ÿ It is also customary to retain the original diacritics in the transcription of proper names written in Latin characters in the original language such as Å or Ø These diacritical letters are considered unique graphemes The same applies to graphemes resulting from elision: c ç d j l m n s t and z The sixteenthcentury typographical use of "q̃" for "que" notably by Joachim du Bellay and Jean de Sponde could lead us to consider it a diacritical letter But it is rather the transcription of an abbreviation from a Tironian notes! colspan"27" ! scope"row" ! scope"row" ! scope"row" ! scope"row" ! scope"row" ! scope"row" ! scope"row" ! scope"row" ! scope"row" ! scope"row" <small></small>

 Uncertain status 

 In language theory 
File:Le Bourgeois gnetilhomme II 4jpgThe existence of oneletter words goes against Platonic language theory as letters are meant to be sublexical units intended to be combined with others to form words As a result Platonism
Reflections on the meaning and importance of oneletter words however return to a debate on which Plato took a stance in the Cratylus and which Gérard Genette summarizes as follows:



While contemporary linguists most often agree with Ferdinand de Saussure that "the Sign (semiotics)
As Genette points out this supposed mimesis is not only phonic but sometimes graphic too:

For Antoine Court de Gébelin
It should come as no surprise for Gébelin:



According to Gébelin all writing is "hieroglyphic" ie "made up of pure pictoideograms" Consequently "alphabetic writing is hieroglyphic  each letter being the painting of an object" However Genette notes that this does not imply the alphabet directly represents sounds



Philologist Antoine Fabre dOlivet a contemporary of Gébelin and influenced by him believes that the oneletter word represents "a simple noncompounded noncomplex thing such as a singlestranded rope"
File:Gold Bug cryptogramjpgIn another register the words of a letter can be a key to the analysis of a text or language Edgar Allan Poe in The GoldBug as a prelude to the exposition of a method using frequency analysis underlines the status of the words of a letter as a cryptological key when the spacing of the original text is preserved which is not the case for the cryptogram of his short story:


It was thanks to such a word that Charles Virolleaud succeeded in 1929 in deciphering the Ugaritic alphabet File:Lougaritiquepng
 In dictionaries 
Due to the polysemy of oneletter words Crossword
Craig Conley has devoted a 232page reference book to oneletter words OneLetter Words: a Dictionary in which he counts over a thousand different meanings for English oneletter words which leads him to emphasize the importance of context in understanding these words For example he lists 76 meanings of the word "X" to which he says he has a particular affection including 17 in the "texts and proverbs" section three in the "cards spirits and adult films" section eight in the "on parchment paper" section 15 in the "crosswords" section five in the "Dr/Mr/Mrs/Miss X" section 11 in the "scientific subjects" section eight in the "mathematics" section three in the "foreign meanings" section eight in the "miscellaneous" section and two in the "facts and figures" section According to him the only other work on the subject is a dictionary of oneletter words in Pali compiled by the sixteenthcentury Buddhist lexicographer Saddhammakitti and entitled Ekakkharakosa

English lexicographer Jonathon Green a specialist in the English slang language has compiled a large number of oneletter word meanings in English most of which do not appear in Conleys dictionary The following table compares the number of meanings given to English oneletter words by these two lexicographers

This evocation of Lewis Carrolls text is all the more appropriate to the challenge of a dictionary of the words of a letter since the description of the meaning of these words must include meanings that are not only nominative ie relative to the use of language in general but also stipulative ie decided by an author in a particular context as Humpty Dumpty
Block quote
"The question" said Alice "is whether you have the power to make words mean something other than what they mean"

"The question" retorted HumptyDumpty "is who will be the master period"

 In practice 
File:Desmond Llewelyn 01jpgJack Goody believes that the written word "adds an important dimension to many social actions" In this respect the words of a letter can be divisive In legal terms their use in Patronymic
A notable example of the social impact of choosing a oneletter surname is the case of American preacher Malcolm X
Georges Perec underlines the special status of X: "this letter that has become a word this noun that is unique in the language in having only one letter unique also in that it is the only one to have the shape of what it designates

In other cases on the contrary social norms justify the use of oneletter words For example the use of a single letter for the middle name perceived as valorizing is sometimes accepted eg S for President Harry S Truman
In certain fields such as tickers Ticker symbol
Oneletter words are also used extensively in SMS particularly when the Homophony
 In literature 

 Work titles

Unbeknownst to Joyce F would be written by Daniel Kehlmann in 2013 Q (novel)
Other literary works with oneletter titles include: A by Louis Zukofsky G by John Berger H by Philippe Sollers R by Céline Minard S by John Updike V by Thomas Pynchon and Z by Vassilis Vassilikos
Several films also have a singleletter title such as Alexandre Arcadys K Oliver Stones W (film)
 Poetic experiences 
File:Champ fleury 18r croppedjpgSeveral writers such as Victor Hugo Paul Claudel and Francis Ponge have taken an interest in the letter as ideomimography Various oneletter poems have prompted exegesis on their semantic value and whether or not they are words This is particularly true of works by Russian poets of the futurist Zaum movement including Vasilisk Gnedov Aleksej Kručënyx and Ilia Zdanevich American minimalist poet Aram Saroyan is the author of Untitled posterpoem a poem consisting of an m with four legs which Bob Grumman places "at the center of an alphabet in formation between the m and the n" cited by the Guinness World RecordsFile:Poem Wrapping City Block 006jpgAmerican poet Dave Morice estimated that English allows only fiftytwo oneletter words: twentysix upper case and twentysix lower case He also indulged in a literary experiment in the 1970s inventing a female "alter ego" Joyce Holland a minimalist poet played by his partner P J Casteel whose existence was acknowledged even by The The New York Times
 Oulipo and oneletter poetry 
File:Hugo  le YjpgOneletter words play a role in the Oulipian constraint a form of rhopalic verse in which the first line consists of a oneletter word But above all they are the subject of a notable experiment by François Le Lionnais dating from 1957 and published in La Littérature potentielle in 1973 of "Réduction dun poème à une seule lettre" The poem was formulated as "T" On the following page he comments:
This short poem has been the subject of "formidable glosses" within the Oulipo

In Écrits français Harry Mathews attempts a "textual explanation" He observes that "the only letter in the poem  is not a letter by itself but a letter followed by a period Punctuation transforms what would otherwise be a sufficient if mysterious entity into an abbreviation" According to Harry Mathews this is in fact a reduction of a device comparable to Raymond Queneaus Hundred Thousand Billion Poems He designed on the principle of perpetual motion that the following sentence would be inscribed on the front and back of a page: "Jai inventé le mouvement perpétuel TSVP" (I invented perpetual motion TSVP) Bénabou then proceeded to make successive reductions eventually inscribing only "T" on one side of a page

In 2006 Marcel Bénabou resumed his analysis of the poem in Miniature persane While praising Harry Mathews "learned commentary" on the point he considers that "there is nothing to prevent from thinking that it could be  a period" and that "in the authors mind there is a hesitation as to the exact nature of his attempt and of the work to which said attempt has led" For Bénabou the choice of the letter T is explained primarily by personal reasons but also by the characteristics of this consonant which is at once homophonic polyphonic and polysemous Bénabou observes however that Le Lionnais "doesnt seem to have taken any notice" of the "properly oral" dimension of the oneletter word and in this connection evokes an "oulipien debate" for which Jacques Bens proposed I which should read "un en chiffre romain et en garamond gras" or "one in Roman numerals and in bold garamond" as it were Finally Bénabou recalls an anecdote told by JeanJacques Rousseau in his Confessions (Rousseau)

He believes that the reader should also assure Le Lionnais that his poem is worth more than he thinks as it "in no way leads to a dead end but on the contrary to fantastic enrichment"

In 2007 Jacques Jouet finally responded to Le Lionnais call asking his Oulipo colleagues to "renew the gesture" by composing their own reduction Among the responses François Caradec proposed reducing Un coup de dés jamais nabolira le hasard (Mallarmé)
