The healthcare error proliferation model is an adaptation of James Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model designed to illustrate the complexity inherent in the contemporary healthcare delivery system and the attribution of human error within these systems  The healthcare error proliferation model explains the etiology of error and the sequence of events typically leading to adverse outcomes  This model emphasizes the role organizational and external cultures contribute to error identification prevention mitigation and defense construction

 Introduction 
Healthcare systems are complex in that they are diverse in both structure (eg nursing units pharmacies emergency departments operating rooms) and professional mix (eg nurses physicians pharmacists administrators therapists) and made up of multiple interconnected elements with adaptive tendencies in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience The term complex adaptive systems (CAS) was coined at the interdisciplinary Santa Fe Institute (SFI) by John Henry Holland
 Model overview 
The healthcare error proliferation model (HEPM) adapts the Swiss Cheese Model to the complexity of healthcare delivery systems and integrated organizations  The Swiss Cheese Model likens the complex adaptive system to multiple hole infested slices of Swiss cheese positioned sidebyside  The cheese slices are dubbed defensive layers to describe their role and function as the system location outfitted with features capable of intercepting and deflecting hazards The layers represent discrete locations or organizational levels potentially populated with errors permitting error progression The four layers include: 1) organizational leadership 2) risky supervision 3) situations for unsafe practices and 4) unsafe performance

The HEPM portrays hospitals as having multiple operational defensive layers outfitted with essential elements necessary to maintain key defensive barricades (Cook & OConnor 2005; Reason 2000) By examining the defensive layers attributes prospective locales of failure the etiology of accidents might be revealed (Leape et al 1995) Experts have discussed the importance of examining these layers within the context of the complex adaptive healthcare system (Kohn et al 2000; Wiegmann & Shappell 2003) and considering the psychological safety of clinicians  Hence this model expands Reason’s seminal work

The model incorporates the complex adaptive healthcare system as a key characteristic  Complex adaptive systems characteristically demonstrate selforganization as diverse agents interact spontaneously in nonlinear relationships  where professionals act as information processors (Cilliers 1998; McDaniel & Driebe 2001) and coevolve with the environment (Casti 1997) Healthcare professionals function in the system as diverse actors within the complex environment utilizing different methods to process information (Coleman 1999) and solve systemic problems within and across organizational layers (McDaniel & Driebe 2001)

 Definitions 
A complex adaptive healthcare system (CAHS) is a care delivery enterprise with diverse clinical and administrative agents acting spontaneously interacting in nonlinear networks where agents and patients are information processors and actively coevolve with their environment with the purposed to produce safe and reliable patientcentered outcomes
