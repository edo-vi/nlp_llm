The CronullaSutherland Sharks footy supplements saga was a sports controversy which began in 2011 The CronullaSutherland Sharks a professional rugby league club playing in the National Rugby League (NRL) The NRL later offered all five players a oneyear ban backdated to an effective sixmonth suspension if they pleaded guilty to taking a banned substance Sports scientist Stephen Dank provided sworn testimony about what involvement he had at Cronulla and which Staff and coaches were involved

Dank publicly admitted to overseeing a regimen that involved the administration of two growth hormonereleasing peptides CJC1295 and GHRP6 Dank has never faced criminal charges in relation to dealing in or administering the aforementioned peptides Both substances are banned by the World AntiDoping Code Dank admits both were injected into Cronulla players

Drug Injections
The admission is significant both for the 12 players who pleaded guilty claiming they had no knowledge of what they were given and for five players who refused the Australian Sports AntiDoping Authority’s plea deal and were waiting for their cases to be resolved

Central figures in the Cronulla saga entered the witness box — head coach and head of the football department Shane Flanagan head trainer and close friend of Flanagan Mark Noakes former club doctor David Givney physiotherapist Konrad Schultz highperformance manager Trent Elkin and football manager Darren Mooney

The Cronulla players were introduced to Stephen Dank by Shane Flanagan Mark Noakes and Trent Elkin and told to work with him and trust him They were given false assurances by Dank Flanagan and Elkin about the substances they were given and that they were permitted for use in sport

What records were kept of players being injected? None

Dank told the court that every week he had provided Elkin with a list of all the treatments administered “I suspect the records were there like I left at every football club’’ he said Elkin said no such records were kept Dank’s work at Cronulla was loosely managed and undocumented

When Givney asked for details about what the players were given he received a vague reply about amino acids and vitamins Givney raised concern with Shane Flanagan regarding the practices of Dank however he was dismissed and eventually stood back and accepted the practices The similarity with how Dank operated at Essendon a year later is striking
The process had serious ramifications and adverse effects on the football club as a whole A number of senior staff were either dismissed or resigned matches were played at a subpar standard as players were physically emotionally and socially affected and it partially played a role in the club winning the Australian rugby league wooden spooners
Senior staff no longer at the club due to the controversy include Damian Irvine (former chairman) who stood down on learning of the malpractice and process failings of Flanagan and his offfield team Bruno Cullen (former CEO) Darren Mooney (former football manager) Mark Noakes (head trainer) and Trent Elkin (former club trainer) among others

Shane Flanagans suspension expired on 31 October 2014 whilst Trent Elkin is not allowed to work at another NRL club as part of his punishment

Background
