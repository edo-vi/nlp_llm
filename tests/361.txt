"Century of humiliation" or  "hundred years of national humiliation" is a term used in China to describe the period of intervention and subjugation of the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China (1912–1949)
The use of "humiliation" arose in the atmosphere of rising Chinese nationalism opposing the TwentyOne Demands made by the Japanese government in 1915 and grew with protests against Chinas treatment in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 The Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) and Chinese Communist Party popularized the characterization in the 1920s protesting the Unequal Treaties and loss of territory In the 1930s and 1940s it became common to refer to "A Century of Humiliation"  Although the formal treaty provisions were ended the idea remains a central concept in Chinese nationalism widely used in both political and popular culture

End of humiliation
Already during the conclusion of the Boxer Protocol in 1901 some of the Western powers believed they had acted in excess and that the Protocol was too humiliating As a result US Secretary of State John Hay formulated the Open Door Policy which prevented the colonial powers from directly carving up China into de jure colonies and guaranteed universal trade access to markets in China Intended to weaken Germany Japan and Russia it was only somewhat enforced and was gradually broken by the following Warlord Era

File:Destroying Chinese war junks by E Duncan (1843)jpgHistorians have judged the Qing dynastys vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness but it achieved military success against Westerners on land The historian Edward L Dreyer stated "Chinas nineteenthcentury humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea At the start of the First Opium War China had no unified navy and not a sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea British navy forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go In the Second Opium War (1856–60) the Chinese had no way to prevent the AngloFrench navy expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing Meanwhile new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury List of rebellions in ChinaPearson Education Inc 2007) p 180</ref>

The historian Jane E Elliott criticized the allegation that China refused to modernize or was unable to defeat Western armies as simplistic by noting that China embarked on a massive military modernization in the late 1800s after several defeats bought weapons from Western countries and manufactured its own at arsenals such as the Hanyang Arsenal during the Boxer Rebellion In addition Elliott questioned the claim that Chinese society was traumatized by the Western victories as many Chinese peasants (then 90% of the population) lived outside the concessions and continued about their daily lives uninterrupted and without any feeling of "humiliation"
