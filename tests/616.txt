An attenuated vaccine (or a live attenuated vaccine LAV) is a vaccine created by reducing the virulence of a pathogen but still keeping it viable (or "live") Attenuation takes an infectious agent and alters it so that it becomes harmless or less virulent These vaccines contrast to those produced by "killing" the pathogen (inactivated vaccine)

Attenuated vaccines stimulate a strong and effective immune response that is longlasting In comparison to inactivated vaccines attenuated vaccines produce a stronger and more durable immune response with a quick immunity onset They are generally avoided in patients with severe immunodeficiencies Attenuated vaccines function by encouraging the body to create Antibody
Development

 Attenuated viruses 
Viruses may be attenuated using the principles of evolution via serial passage of the virus through a foreign host (biology) Tissue culture
 Embryonated egg (biology) Live animals

The initial virus population is applied to a foreign host Through natural genetic variability or induced mutation a small percentage of the viral particles should have the capacity to infect the new host These strains will continue to evolve within the new host and the virus will gradually lose its efficacy in the original host due to lack of selection pressure This process is known as "passage" in which the virus becomes so well adapted to the foreign host that it is no longer harmful to the subject that is to receive the vaccine This makes it easier for the host immune system to eliminate the agent and create the immunological memory cells which will likely protect the patient if they are infected with a similar version of the virus in "the wild"

Viruses may also be Reverse geneticsVaccine synthesis
 Attenuated bacteria 
Bacteria is typically attenuated by passage similar to the method used in viruses Gene knockout guided by reverse genetics is also used

 Administration 
Attenuated vaccines can be administered in a variety of ways:
 Injections:
 Subcutaneous (eg MMR vaccine Intradermal (eg Tuberculosis vaccines Mucosal:
 Nasal (eg live attenuated influenza vaccine)
 Oral (eg oral polio vaccine Recombinant DNA
Oral vaccines or subcutaneous/intramuscular injection are for individuals older than 12 months Live attenuated vaccines with the exception of the rotavirus vaccine given at 6 weeks is not indicated for infants younger than 9 months

Mechanism
Vaccines function by encouraging the creation of cells such as Cytotoxic T cell
Attenuated vaccines are “weakened” version of pathogens (virus or bacteria) They are modified so that it cannot cause harm or disease in the body but are still able to activate the immune system This type of vaccine works by activating both the cellular and humoral immune responses of the adaptive immune system When a person receives an oral or injection of the vaccine B cells which help make antibodies are activated in two ways: T celldependent and Tcell independent

In Tcell dependent activation of B cells B cells first recognize and present the antigen on MHCII receptors Tcells can then recognize this presentation and bind to the B cell resulting in clonal proliferation This also helps IgM and plasma cells production as well as immunoglobulin switching On the other hand Tcell independent activation of B cells is due to nonprotein antigens This can lead to production of IgM antibodies Being able to produce a Bcell response as well as memory killer T cells is a key feature of attenuated virus vaccines that help induce a potent immunity

 Safety 
Liveattenuated vaccines are safe and stimulate a strong and effective immune response that is longlasting Additionally within the five WHOrecommended live attenuated vaccines (tuberculosis oral polio measles rotavirus and yellow fever) severe adverse reactions are extremely rare

Individuals with severely compromised immune systems (eg HIV
As precaution liveattenuated vaccines are not typically administered during Immunization during pregnancy
Some live attenuated vaccines have additional common mild adverse effects due to their administration route For example the live attenuated influenza vaccine is given nasally and is associated with nasal congestion

Compared to inactivated vaccines liveattenuated vaccines are more prone to immunization errors as they must be kept under strict conditions during the cold chain and carefully prepared (eg during reconstitution)

 History 
The history of vaccine development started with the creation of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in the late 18th century Jenner discovered that inoculating a human with an animal Poxviridae
The technique of cultivating a virus repeatedly in artificial media and isolating less Virulence
Advantages and disadvantages

 Advantages 
 Accurately imitate natural infections
 Are effective at evoking both strong antibody and Cellmediated immunity Can elicit longlasting or lifelong immunity
 Often only one or two doses are required
 Quick immunity onset
 Costeffective (compared to some other health interventions)
 Can have strong beneficial Nonspecific effect of vaccines
 Disadvantages 
 In rare cases particularly when there is inadequate vaccination of the population natural mutations during viral replication or interference by related viruses can cause an attenuated virus to revert to its Wild type Often not recommended for severely Immunodeficiency Live strains typically require advanced maintenance such as refrigeration and fresh media making transport to remote areas difficult and costly
