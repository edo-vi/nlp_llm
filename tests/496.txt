The Greek Dark Ages was the period of History of Greece
It was previously thought that all contact was lost between mainland Hellenes and foreign powers during this period yielding little cultural progress or growth But archaeologist Alex Knodell considers that artifacts from excavations at Lefkandi on the Lelantine Plain in Euboea in the 1980s "revealed that some parts of Greece were much wealthier and more widely connected than traditionally thought as a monumental building and its adjacent cemetery showed connections to Cyprus Egypt and the Levant as markers of elite status and authority much as they had been in previous periods" and this shows that significant cultural and trade links with the east particularly the Levant coast developed from  onwards Additionally evidence has emerged of the new presence of Hellenes in subMycenaean Cyprus and on the Syrian coast at AlMina

During the Dark Ages of Greece the old major settlements were abandoned (with the notable exception of Athens) and the population dropped dramatically Within these three hundred years the people of Greece lived in small groups that moved constantly in accordance with their new pastoral lifestyle and livestock needs while they left no written record behind leading to the conclusion that they were illiterate Later in the Dark Ages (between 950 and 750 BC) Greeks relearned how to write once again but this time instead of using the Linear B script used by the Mycenaeans they adopted the alphabet used by the Phoenicians "innovating in a fundamental way by introducing vowels as letters The Greek version of the alphabet eventually formed the base of the alphabet used for English today"

Life was harsh for the Greeks of the Dark Ages One major result of the period is the deconstruction of the old Mycenaean economic and social structures The strict class hierarchies and hereditary rule were forgotten and gradually replaced with new sociopolitical institutions that eventually allowed for the rise of democracy in 5th c BC Athens Notable events from the Dark Ages period that mark the transition to Classical Antiquity include the first Ancient Olympic Games
 Mediterranean warfare and Sea Peoples 
Around this time largescale revolts took place in several parts of the eastern Mediterranean Attempts to overthrow existing kingdoms were made as a result of economic and political instability by surrounding people who were already plagued with famine and hardship Parts of Western Anatolia were possibly attacked by the socalled Sea Peoples whose origins perhaps from different parts of the Mediterranean region such as the Black Sea the Aegean and Anatolian regions remain obscure

With the collapse of the palatial centers no more monumental stone buildings were built and the practice of wall painting may have ceased Writing in the Linear B script also ceased and vital trade links were lost as towns and villages were abandoned Writing in the Linear B script ended particularly due to the redistributive palace economy crashing; there was no longer a need to keep records about commerce<ref>The Early Greek Dark Age and Revival in the Near East
http://wwwperseustuftsedu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999040009%3Achapter%3D3 Retrieved 2016124</ref> The population of Greece declined The world of organized state armies kings officials and redistributive systems disappeared Most of the information about the period comes from burial sites and the grave goods contained within them

The emerging fragmented localized and autonomous cultures lacked cultural and aesthetic cohesion and are noted for their diversity of material cultures in pottery styles (eg conservative in Athens eclectic in Knossos) burial practices and settlement structures The Protogeometric style of pottery was stylistically simpler than earlier designs characterized by lines and curves Generalizations about the "Dark Ages (historiography)
Tholos tombs are found in early Iron Age Thessaly and in Crete but not in general elsewhere and cremation was the dominant rite in Attica but nearby in the Argolid it was inhumation Some former sites of Mycenaean palaces such as Ancient Argos
Some regions in Greece such as Attica Euboea and central Crete recovered economically from these events faster than others but life for common Greeks would have remained relatively unchanged as it had for centuries There was still farming weaving metalworking and pottery but at a lower level of output and for local use in local styles Some technical innovations were introduced around 1050&nbsp;BC with the start of the Protogeometric style (1050–900&nbsp;BC) such as the superior pottery technology that included a faster potters wheel for superior vase shapes and the use of a compass to draw perfect circles and semicircles for decoration Better glazes were achieved by higher temperature firing of the clay However the overall trend was toward simpler less intricate pieces and fewer resources being devoted to the creation of beautiful art

The smelting of iron was learned from Cyprus and the Levant and was exploited and improved upon by using local deposits of iron ore previously ignored by the Mycenaeans: edged weapons were now within reach of less elite warriors Though the universal use of iron was one shared feature among Dark Age settlements it is still uncertain when the forged iron weapons and armour achieved strength superior to those that had previously been cast and hammered from bronze From 1050 many small local iron industries appeared and by 900 almost all weapons in grave goods were made of iron

The distribution of the Ionic Greek dialect in historic times indicates early movement from mainland Greece to the Anatolian coast to such sites as Miletus Ephesus and Colophon (city)
PostMycenaean Cyprus

Society
Greece during this period was likely divided into independent regions organized by kinship groups and the oikos
This was a larger structure than those surrounding it but it was still made from the same materials (mud brick and thatched roof) It was perhaps also a place of religious significance and communal storage of food Highstatus individuals did in fact exist in the Dark Age but their standard of living was not significantly higher than others of their village Most Greeks did not live in isolated farmsteads but in small settlements It is likely that at the dawn of the historical period two or three hundred years later the main economic resource for each family was the ancestral plot of land of the Oikos the kleros or allotment Without this a man could not marry

Lefkandi burial
Lefkandi on the island of Euboea was a prosperous settlement in the Late Bronze Age possibly to be identified with old Eretria It recovered quickly from the collapse of Mycenaean culture and in 1981 excavators of a burial ground found the largest 10thcentury building yet known from Greece Sometimes called "the heroon" this long narrow building 50 metres by 10 metres or about 164 feet by 33 feet contained two burial shafts In one were placed four horses and the other contained a cremated male buried with his iron weapons and an inhumed woman heavily adorned with gold jewellery 

The mans bones were placed in a bronze jar from Cyprus with hunting scenes on the cast rim The woman was clad with gold coils in her hair rings gold breastplates an heirloom necklace an elaborate Cypriot or Near Eastern necklace made some 200 to 300 years before her burial and an ivoryhandled dagger at her head The horses appeared to have been sacrificed some appearing to have iron bits in their mouths No evidence survives to show whether the building was erected to house the burial or whether the "hero" or local chieftain in the grave was cremated and then buried in his grand house; whichever is true the house was soon demolished and the debris used to form a roughly circular mound over the wall stumps

Between this period and approximately 820&nbsp;BC rich members of the community were cremated and buried close to the eastern end of the building in much the same way Christians might seek to be buried close to a saints grave; the presence of imported objects notable throughout more than eighty further burials contrast with other nearby cemeteries at Lefkandi and attest to a lasting elite tradition

End
File:AGM Ancient Greek Pair of Terracotta BootsjpgThe archaeological record of many sites demonstrates that the economic recovery of Greece was well underway by the beginning of the 8th century &nbsp;BC Cemeteries such as the Kerameikos in Athens or Lefkandi and sanctuaries such as Olympia recently founded in Delphi or the Heraion of Samos first of the colossal freestanding temples were richly provided with offerings – including items from the Near East Egypt and Italy made of exotic materials including amber and ivory Exports of Greek pottery demonstrate contact with the Levant coast at sites such as AlMina and with the region of the Villanovan culture to the north of Rome

The decoration of pottery became more elaborate and included Geometric art
New writing system
By the midtolate8th century BC a new Greek alphabet system was adopted from the Phoenician alphabet by a Greek with firsthand experience of it The Greeks adapted the abjad used to write Phoenician language
The ceramic Euboean artifact inscribed with a few lines written in the Greek alphabet referring to "Nestors Cup (Pithekoussai)
Continuity thesis
Some scholars have argued against the concept of a Greek Dark Age on grounds that the former lack of archaeological evidence in a period that was mute in its lack of inscriptions (thus "dark") is an accident of discovery rather than a fact of history As James Whitley has put it "The Dark Age of Greece is our conception It is a conception strongly coloured by our knowledge of the two literate civilisations that preceded and succeeded it: the bureaucratic palacecentred world of Mycenaean Greece and the chaotic and creative Archaic age of Hellenic civilisation"
