*Arthritis and other rheumatoid disorders
*Chronic application of external forces e.g. artificial cranial deformation
*Chronic paresis paralysis or muscle imbalance especially in children e.g. due to poliomyelitis or cerebral palsy
*Complications at childbirth*Damage to the fetus or uterus
*Fractured bones left to heal without being properly Reduction (orthopedic_surgery)*Genetic mutation
*Growth or hormone disorders
*Infection
*Reconstructive surgery following a severe injury e.g. Third degree burn
Deformity can occur in all organisms:

* Frogs can be mutated due to RibeiroiaRibeiroia (Trematoda) infection.
* Plant* Insect* Fish can be found with scoliosis due to environmental factors

The mortality of severely deformed births may be due to a range of complications including missing or non-functioning vital organs structural defects that prevent necessary function high susceptibility to injuries abnormal facial appearance or infections that eventually lead to death.

In some cases such as that of Twin
