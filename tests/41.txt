Reverse vaccinology is an improvement of vaccinology that employs bioinformatics and reverse pharmacology practices pioneered by Rino Rappuoli and first used against Serogroup B meningococcus Since then it has been used on several other bacterial vaccines

Computational approach
The basic idea behind reverse vaccinology is that an entire pathogenic genome can be screened using bioinformatics approaches to find genes  Some traits that the genes are monitored for may indicate antigenicity and include genes that code for proteins with Extracellular matrix
History
After Craig Venter published the genome of the first freeliving organism in 1995 the genomes of other microorganisms became more readily available throughout the end of the twentieth century Reverse vaccinology designing vaccines using the pathogens sequenced genome came from this new wealth of genomic information as well as technological advances Reverse vaccinology is much more efficient than traditional vaccinology which requires growing large amounts of specific microorganisms as well as extensive wet lab tests

In 2000 Rino Rappuoli and the J Craig Venter Institute developed the first vaccine using Reverse Vaccinology against Serogroup B meningococcus The J Craig Venter Institute and others then continued work on vaccines for A Streptococcus B Streptococcus Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae


Reverse vaccinology with Meningococcus B
Attempts at reverse vaccinology first began with Meningococcus B (MenB) Meningococcus B caused over 50% of meningococcal meningitis and scientists had been unable to create a successful vaccine for the pathogen because of the bacteriums unique structure This bacteriums polysaccharide shell is identical to that of a human selfantigen but its surface proteins vary greatly; and the lack of information about the surface proteins caused developing a vaccine to be extremely difficult As a result Rino Rappuoli and other scientists turned towards bioinformatics to design a functional vaccine

Rappuoli and others at the J Craig Venter Institute first sequenced the MenB genome Then they scanned the sequenced genome for potential antigens They found over 600 possible antigens which were tested by expression in Escherichia coli The most universally applicable antigens were used in the prototype vaccines Several proved to function successfully in mice however these proteins alone did not effectively interact with the human immune system due to not inducing a good immune response in order for the protection to be achieved Later  by addition of outer membrane vesicles that contain lipopolysaccharides from the purification of blebs on gram negative cultures The addition of this adjuvant (previously identified by using conventional vaccinology approaches) enhanced immune response to the level that was required Later the vaccine was proven to be safe and effective in adult humans

Subsequent reverse vaccinology research
During the development of the MenB vaccine scientists adopted the same Reverse Vaccinology methods for other bacterial pathogens A Streptococcus and B Streptococcus vaccines were two of the first Reverse Vaccines created Because those bacterial strains induce antibodies that react with human antigens the vaccines for those bacteria needed to not contain homologies to proteins encoded in the human genome in order to not cause adverse reactions thus establishing the need for genomebased Reverse Vaccinology

Later Reverse Vaccinology was used to develop vaccines for antibioticresistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae 

Pros and cons
The major advantage for reverse vaccinology is finding vaccine targets quickly and efficiently Traditional methods may take decades to unravel pathogens and antigens diseases and immunity However In silico can be very fast allowing to identify new vaccines for testing in only a few years  The downside is that only proteins can be targeted using this process  Whereas conventional vaccinology approaches can find other biomolecular targets such as polysaccharides

Available software
Though using bioinformatic technology to develop vaccines has become typical in the past ten years general laboratories often do not have the advanced software that can do this However there are a growing number of programs making reverse vaccinology information more accessible NERVE is one relatively new data processing program Though it must be downloaded and does not include all epitope predictions it does help save some time by combining the computational steps of reverse vaccinology into one program Vaxign an even more comprehensive program was created in 2008 Vaxign is webbased and completely publicaccess

Though Vaxign has been found to be extremely accurate and efficient some scientists still utilize the online software RANKPEP for the peptide bonding predictions Both Vaxign and RANKPEP employ PSSMs (Position Specific Scoring Matrices) when analyzing protein sequences or sequence alignments

ComputerAided bioinformatics projects are becoming extremely popular as they help guide the laboratory experiments

Other developments because of reverse vaccinology and bioinformatics
 Reverse vaccinology has caused an increased focus on pathogenic biology
 Reverse vaccinology led to the discovery of pili in grampositive pathogens such as A streptococcus B streptococcus and pneumococcus Previously all grampositive bacteria were thought to not have any pili
 Reverse vaccinology also led to the discovery of factor G binding protein in meningococcus which binds to complement factor H in humans Binding to the complement factor H allows for meningococcus to grow in human blood while blocking alternative pathways This model does not fit many animal species which do not have the same complement factor H as humans indicating differentiation of meningococcus between differing species
