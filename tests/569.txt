 Content and format 
ScienceBased Medicine is a website in blog format that examines controversies in science and medicine especially Quackery
Editorial staff say that the best medicine is based on scientific principles includes prior plausibility and is not based on evidence alone and stress that randomized clinical trials should only be conducted when warranted by ample preclinical evidence to justify the effort time and expenses involved For a sciencebased approach Novella supports minimizing or eliminating research on implausible treatments and points out that decades are often required for clinical research to become supported by rigorous conclusive trials during which time decisions must be made preferably guided by and screened by plausibility criteria

In a systematic survey of web sites providing material on complementary and alternative medicine from 2018 medical education researcher Annie Chen and colleagues listed ScienceBased Medicine alongside WebMD as an example of an "information service" providing articles on health and illness

During the COVID19 pandemic ScienceBased Medicine collected and debunked misinformation that had spread through social media such as the false claim that COVID19 vaccines could cause infertility

 Retractions 
On June 15 2021 ScienceBased Medicine published a book review of Abigail Shriers Irreversible Damage written by founding editor Harriet Hall In her review Hall wrote that Shriers book had raised legitimate concerns about the science surrounding drug treatments for gender dysphoria in children and that there was a lack of quality scientific studies on the subject
