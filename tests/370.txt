An anime music video (AMV) is a Fan labor
AMVs should not be confused with music videos that employ original professionally made animation (such as numerous music videos for songs by Daft Punk) or with such short music video films (such as Japanese duo Chage and Askas song "On Your Mark" that was produced by the film company Studio Ghibli) AMVs should also not be confused with fanmade "general animation" videos using nonJapanese animated video sources like Western animation or with the practice of vidding in Western media fandom which convergent evolution
The first anime music video was created in 1982 by 21yearold Jim Kaposztas Kaposztas hooked up two videocassette recorders to each other and edited the most violent scenes from Star Blazers to "All You Need Is Love" by the Beatles to produce a humorous effect

Creation
The creation of an AMV centers on using various film editing Raw Editing: Using basic zooming in and out "effects" along with simple transitions 
 FX (Effects) Editing: This style consists of large amounts of visual effects This can be accomplished in programs such as Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects
 Timing Editing: The editor edits the clips such that the anime footage is in sync with the lyrics or beats (from the song) to create a perfect harmony (Eg Matching beats to gunshot scenes or making an anime characters lips move to make it seem like the character is saying or singing those words in the AMV)
 Flow Editing: This requires the editor to use transitions and to keep the AMV flowing as opposed to have it consist of rough cuts and choppy parts
 Animation Editing: Although it sounds similar to the term AMV editing it is a new style where editors take a still image and animate it (making it move) (This also applies to Manga Music Videos (MMVs) which are similar to AMVs instead they use manga as the main source of footage)
 Masking: This style requires the editor to remove the background from the anime scene they would like to add effects to It is a painstaking and timeconsuming process
 3D: This style consist of using a builtin camera from the video editing software Usually involves 3D texts or 3D anime characters
 MMV: This style is mostly using manga as opposed to anime with animation and compositing combined
 HMV: This subgenre uses hentai clips instead hence the name hentai music video Unlike other AMVs they are posted exclusively on pornography sites due to explicit sexual content on the source clips which prevented them from being uploaded on most video sites

Popularity
John Oppliger of AnimeNation has noted that fanproduced AMVs are popular mostly with Western fans but not with Japanese fans One reason he cited was that Western fans experience a "more purely" visual experience in as much as most Western fans cannot understand the Japanese language the original language of most anime and as a result "the visuals make a greater impact" on the senses The second reason he cited was that Westerners are "encouraged by social pressure to grow out of cartoons and comics during the onset of adolescence" whereas Japanese natives grow up with animation "as a constant companion";  as a result Englishspeaking fans tend to utilize and reconstruct existing anime to create AMVs whereas Japanese fans "are more intuitively inclined" to create or expand on existing manga and anime

 Legal issues 
Japanese culture is generally permissive with regard to the appropriation of ideas Works such as  unauthorized comics continuing the story of an official comic series are actually encouraged by many anime makers These  take an original copyrighted work and expand upon the story allowing the characters to continue on after before or during the original story Most anime producers encourage this practice as it expands their series Some see it as a tribute while others see it from a business viewpoint that it draws in more support for the anime than it would have had otherwise Some Mangaka
In an interview with site AnimeNewsNetwork Funimation
In recent years there has been an increased demand primarily on the part of the record industry for the removal of AMVs from sites like YouTube and AnimeMusicVideosorg with particular regard to YouTube due to its relative popularity as well as its forprofit status Public discussions and perspectives give varying accounts of exactly how widespread these actions have become Most notably in November 2005 the administrator of AnimeMusicVideosorg (Phade) was contacted by Windup Records requesting the removal of content featuring the work of the bands Creed (band)
While music labels and corporations generally see AMVs in negative light often the actual musical artists in question do not hold the same views  A number of AMV editors report to having had positive contact with various artists including Trey Gunn and Mae Japanese electronic duo Boom Boom Satellites teamed with site AMVJ Remix Sessions to sanction an AMV competition to help promote one of their singles going so far as to provide the source material for editors to use The winners video would be featured during one of the pairs tours The first of this competition took place in January 2008 using the song "Easy Action" and the anime movie Vexille A second competition took place later that year in November using the song "Shut Up and Explode" and the anime Xamd: Lost Memories

In his book Code: Version 20 and a subsequent talk in Googles AtGoogleTalks Authors Series Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig specifically mentions AMVs as an example when dealing with the legality and creative nature of digital remix culture
