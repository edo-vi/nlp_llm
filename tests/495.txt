A vaccine trial is a clinical trial that aims at establishing the safety and vaccine efficacy
A vaccine candidate drug is first identified through preclinical evaluations that could involve high throughput screening and selecting the proper antigen to invoke an immune response

Some vaccine trials may take months or years to complete depending on the time required for the subjects to react to the vaccine and develop the required Antibody
Preclinical stage
Preclinical development stages are necessary to determine the immunogenicity potential and safety profile for a vaccine candidate

This is also the stage in which the drug candidate may be first tested in laboratory animals prior to moving to the Phases of clinical researchPhase I
Recent scientific advances have helped to use transgenic animals as a part of vaccine preclinical protocol in hopes to more accurately determine drug reactions in humans Understanding vaccine safety and the immunological response to the vaccine such as toxicity are necessary components of the preclinical stage Other drug trials focus on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics; however in vaccine studies it is essential to understand toxic effects at all possible dosage levels and the interactions with the immune system

 Phase I 

The Phase I study consists of introducing the vaccine candidate to assess its safety in healthy people A vaccine Phase I trial involves normal healthy subjects each tested with either the candidate vaccine or a "control group
After the administration of the vaccine or placebo the researchers collect data on antibody production on health outcomes (such as illness due to the targeted infection or to another infection) Following the protocol (natural sciences)
One typical version of Phase I studies in vaccines involves an escalation study which is used in mainly medicinal research trials The drug is introduced into a small cohort of healthy volunteers Vaccine escalation studies aim to minimize chances of serious adverse effects (SAE) by slowly increasing the drug dosage or frequency The first level of an escalation study usually has two or three groups of around 10 healthy volunteers Each subgroup receives the same vaccine dose which is the expected lowest dose necessary to invoke an immune response (the main goal in a vaccine â€“ to create Immunity (medical)
