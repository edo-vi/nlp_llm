File:Pulse Polio Day Gwalior January 2014jpgThe pulse vaccination strategy is a method used to eradicate an epidemic by repeatedly vaccinating a group at risk over a defined age range until the spread of the pathogen has been stopped It is most commonly used during measles and polio epidemics to quickly stop the spread and contain the outbreak

 Mathematical model 
Where T time units is a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects vaccinated in a relatively short time This yields the differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects as
:

:<math> \frac  \mu N   \mu S  \beta \frac S S(n T^+)  (1p) S(n T^) n012\dots </math>

:<math> \frac   \mu V   V(n T^+)  V(n T^) + p S(n T^) n012\dots</math>

Further by setting  one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:

:<math> S^(t)  1 \fracE^  </math>

and that the eradication condition is:

:<math> R_0 \int_^ < 1  </math>
