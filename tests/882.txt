 Debate 
In geology a debate remains open concerning the use of Myr (duration) plus Ma (million years ago) versus using only the term Ma In either case the term YearSI prefix multipliersThe "ago" is implied so that any such year number "X Ma" between 66 and 145 is "Cretaceous" for good reason But the counter argument is that having myr for a duration and Mya for an age mixes unit systems and tempts capitalization errors: "million" need not be capitalized but "mega" must be; "ma" would technically imply a milliyear (a thousandth of a year or 8 hours) On this side of the debate one avoids myr and simply adds ago explicitly (or adds Before PresentIn this case "79 Ma" means only a quantity of 79 million years without the meaning of "79 million years ago"
