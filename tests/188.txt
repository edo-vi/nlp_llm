An enema also known as a clyster is an injection of fluid into the Large intestine
In standard medicine the most frequent uses of enemas are to relieve constipation and for bowel cleansing before a medical examination or procedure; also they are employed as a lower gastrointestinal series (also called a barium enema) to treat Travelers diarrhea
 Medical usage 

The principal medical usages of enemas are:

 Bowel cleansing 
 Acute treatments 
As bowel stimulants enemas are employed for the same purposes as orally administered laxatives: to relieve constipation; to treat fecal impaction; to empty the colon prior to a medical procedure such as a colonoscopy When oral laxatives are not indicated or are not sufficiently effective enemas may be a sensible and necessary measure

A large volume enema can be given to cleanse as much of the colon as possible of feces However a low enema is generally useful only for stool in the rectum not in the intestinal tract

Such enemas mechanism consists of the volume of the liquid causing a rapid expansion of the intestinal tract in conjunction with in the case of certain solutions irritation of the intestinal mucosa which stimulates peristalsis and lubricates the stool to encourage a bowel movement An enemas efficacy depends on several factors including the volume injected and the temperature and the contents of the infusion In order for the enema to be effective the patient should retain the solution for five to ten minutes as tolerated or as some nursing textbooks recommend for five to fifteen minutes or as long as possible

 Large volume enemas 

File:Soapsuds Enemasjpg
For emptying the entire colon as much as feasible deeper and higher enemas are utilized to reach large sections of the colon The colon dilates and expands when a large volume of liquid is injected into it and the colon reacts to that sudden expansion with general contractions PeristalsisLarge intestine
Soapsuds enema is a frequently used synonym for a large volume enema (although soap is not necessary for effectivity)

For relieving occasional constipation a large volume enema may be used in a home setting although for recurring or severe cases of constipation medical care may be required

 Waterbased solutions 

Plain water can be used simply functioning mechanically to expand the colon thus prompting evacuation

saline (medicine)Normal
Castile soap is commonly added because its irritation of the colons lining increases the urgency to defecate However liquid handsoaps and detergents should not be used

Glycerol is a specific bowel mucosa irritant serving to induce peristalsis via a Osmotic laxative
 Other solutions 

Equal parts of milk and molasses heated together to slightly above normal body temperature have been used Neither the milk sugars and proteins nor the molasses are absorbed in the lower intestine thus keeping the water from the enema in the intestine Studies have shown that milk and molasses enemas have a low complication rate when used in the emergency department and are safe and effective with minimal side effects

Mineral oil functions as a lubricant and stool softener but may have side effects including rectal skin irritation and leakage of oil

 Chronic treatments 
 Transanal irrigation 

TAI also termed retrograde irrigation is designed to assist evacuation using a water enema as a treatment for persons with bowel dysfunction including fecal incontinence or constipation especially obstructed defecation By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation controlled bowel function is often reestablished to a high degree thus enabling development of a consistent bowel routine  Its effectiveness varies considerably some individuals experiencing complete control of incontinence but others reporting little or no benefit

An international consensus on when and how to use transanal irrigation for people with bowel problems was published in 2013 offering practitioners a clear comprehensive and simple guide to practice for the emerging therapeutic area of transanal irrigation

The term retrograde irrigation distinguishes this procedure from the Malone antegrade continence enema where irrigation fluid is introduced into the colon proximal to the anus via a surgically created irrigation port

 Bowel management 

Patients who have a bowel disability a medical condition which impairs control of defecation eg fecal incontinence or constipation can use bowel management techniques to choose a predictable time and place to evacuate Without bowel management such persons might either suffer from the feeling of not getting relief or they might soil themselves

While simple techniques might include a controlled Healthy diet
 Contrast (Xray) 

File:Barium Contrast Enemajpg
In a lower gastrointestinal series an enema that may contain Barium sulphateRadiocontrast agent
Failure to expel all of the barium may cause constipation or possible impaction and a patient who has no bowel movement for more than two days or is unable to pass gas rectally should promptly inform a physician and may require an enema or laxative

 Medication administration 

The administration of substances into the bloodstream This may be done in situations where it is undesirable or impossible to deliver a medication by mouth such as antiemetics given to reduce nausea (though not many antiemetics are delivered by enema) Additionally several antiangiogenic agents which work better without digestion can be safely administered via a gentle enema

The topical administration of medications into the rectum such as corticosteroids and mesalazine used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease Administration by enema avoids having the medication pass through the entire gastrointestinal tract therefore simplifying the delivery of the medication to the affected area and limiting the amount that is absorbed into the bloodstream

Rectal corticosteroid enemas are sometimes used to treat mild or moderate ulcerative colitis They also may be used along with systemic (oral or injection) corticosteroids or other medicines to treat severe disease or mild to moderate disease that has spread too far to be treated effectively by medicine inserted into the rectum alone

 Inhibiting pathological defecation 
 Travellers diarrheas symptoms treated with an enema of sodium butyrate organic acids and A300 silicon dioxide can be successfully decreased with lack of observed side effects
 Shigellosis treatment benefits from adjunct therapy with butyrate enemas promoting healing of the rectal mucosa and inflammation but not helping in clinical recovery from shigellosis Use of an 80 ml of a sodium butyrate isotonic enema administered every 12 hours has been studied and found effective

 Other 
 There have been a few cases in remote or rural settings where rectal fluids have been used to rehydrate a person Benefits include not needing to use sterile fluids
 Introducing healthy bacterial flora through infusion of stool known as a fecal microbiota transplant was first performed in 1958 employing retention enemas Enemas remained the most common method until 1989 when alternative means of administration were developed As of 2013 colonoscope implantation has been preferred over fecal enemas because by using the former method the entire colon and ileum can be inoculated but enemas reach only to the splenic flexure
 A patient unable to be fed otherwise can be nutrition Enemas have been used around the time of childbirth; however there is no evidence for this practice and it is now discouraged

 Adverse effects 

Improper administration of an enema can cause electrolyte imbalance (with repeated enemas) or ruptures to the bowel or rectal tissues resulting in internal bleeding However these occurrences are rare in healthy sobriety
The enema tube and solution may stimulate the vagus nerve which may trigger an Heart arrhythmia
Enemas should not be used if there is an undiagnosed abdominal pain since the peristalsis of the bowel can cause an inflamed Vermiform appendix
There are arguments both for and against colonic irrigation in people with diverticulitis ulcerative colitis Crohns disease severe or internal hemorrhoids or tumors in the rectum or Colon (anatomy)
Recent research has shown that ozone water which is sometimes used in enemas can immediately cause microscopic colitis

A recent case series of 11 patients with five deaths illustrated the danger of phosphate enemas in highrisk patients

 History 

 Etymology 

Enema entered the English language c 1675 from Latin in which in the 15th century

Clyster entered the English language in the late 14th century from Old French or Latin from Greek κλυστήρ (klyster) "syringe" itself from κλύζειν (klyzein) "to wash out" also spelled glister in the 18th century is a generally archaic word used more particularly for enemas administered using a clyster syringe

 Ancient and medieval 
 Africa 

The first mention of the enema in medical literature is in the Ancient Egyptian Ebers Papyrus ( BCE) One of the many types of medical specialists was an Iri the Shepherd of the Anus Many medications were administered by enemas There was a Keeper of the Royal Rectum who may have primarily been the pharaohs enema maker The god Thoth according to Egyptian mythology invented the enema

File:Afrikanische Holzplastikjpg
In parts of Africa the calabash gourd is used traditionally to administer enemas On the Ivory Coast the narrow neck of the gourd filled with water is inserted the patients rectum and the contents are then injected by means of an attendants forcible oral inflation or alternatively a patient may selfadminister the enema by using suction to create a negative pressure in the gourd placing a finger at the opening and then upon anal insertion removing the finger to allow atmospheric pressure to effect the flow Along the upper Congo River an enema apparatus is made by making a hole in one end of the gourd for filling it and using a resin to attach a hollow cane to the gourds neck The cane is inserted into the anus of the patient who is in a posture that allows gravity to effect infusion of the fluid

 Americas 

The Olmec from their middle preclassic period (10th through 7th centuries BCE) through the Spanish Conquest used tranceinducing substances ceremonially and these were ingested via among other routes enemas administered using jars

As further described below in EnemaReligious rituals
For combating illness and discomfort of the digestive tract the Mayan also employed enemas as documented during the colonial period eg in the Florentine Codex

The indigenous peoples of the AmericasNorth America
A rubber bag connected with a conical nozzle at an early period was in use among the indigenous peoples of the AmericasSouth America
 Asia 

In Babylonia by 600 BCE enemas were in use although it appears that initially they were in use because of a belief that the demon of disease would by means of an enema be driven out of the body Babylonian and Assyrian tablets c 600 BCE bear cuneiform inscriptions referring to enemas

In China c 200 CE Zhang Zhongjing<!>Redirected from Chang Chungching the name used in the reference> was the first to employ enemas "Secure a large pigs bile and mix with a small quantity of vinegar Insert a bamboo tube three or four inches long into the rectum and inject the mixture" are his directions according to Wu Lienteh

In India in the fifth century BCE Sushruta enumerates the enema syringe among 121 surgical instruments described Early Indian physicians enema apparatus consisted of a tube of bamboo ivory or horn attached to the scrotum of a deer goat or ox

In Persia Avicenna (980–1037 A D) is credited with the introduction of the "clysterpurse" or collapsible portion of an enema outfit made from ox skin or silk cloth and emptied by squeezing with the hands

 Europe 
File:The Enema MET DP818226jpgHippocrates (460–370 BCE) frequently mentions enemas eg "if the previous food which the patient has recently eaten should not have gone down give an enema if the patient be strong and in the prime of life but if he be weak a suppository should be administered should the bowels be not well moved on their own accord"

In the first century BCE the Ancient Greek medicine
In the second century CE the Greek physician Soranus (Greek physician)
In medieval times appear the first illustrations of enema equipment in the Western world a clyster syringe consisting of a tube attached to a pump action bulb made of a pig bladder
A simple piston syringe clyster was in use from the 15th through 19th centuries This device had its rectal nozzle connected to a syringe with a plunger rather than to a bulb

 Modern Western

File:Clyster syringesjpg
Beginning in the 17th century enema apparatus was chiefly designed for selfadministration at home and many were French as enemas enjoyed wide usage in France

In 1694 François Mauriceau in his earlymodern treatise The Diseases of Women with Child records that both midwives and manmidwives commonly administered clysters to labouring mothers just prior to their delivery

Clysters were administered for symptoms of constipation and with more questionable effectiveness stomach aches and other illnesses

File:A monkey rejects the old style clyster for his new clysopompe which he fills with opium and marshmallow Wellcome V0011775jpg
In 1753 an enema bag prepared from a pigs or beefs bladder attached to a tube was described by Johann Jacob Woyts as an alternative to a syringe

In the 18th century Europeans began emulating the indigenous peoples of the AmericasNorth America
Clysters were a favourite medical treatment in the bourgeoisie and nobility of the Western world up to the 19th century As medical knowledge was fairly limited at the time purgative clysters were used for a wide variety of ailments the foremost of which were stomach aches and constipation

According to Louis de Rouvroy duc de SaintSimon
In the 19th century many new types of enema administration equipment were devised Devices allowing gravity to infuse the solution like those mentioned above used by South American indigenous people and like the enema bag described by Johann Jacob Woyts came into common use These consist of a nozzle at the end of a hose which connects a reservoir either a bucket or a rubber bag which is filled with liquid and held or hung above the recipient

 Society and culture 

 Alternative medicine 

 Relatively benign 

 Colonic irrigation 

The term "colonic irrigation" is commonly used in gastroenterology to refer to the practice of introducing water through a colostomy or a surgically constructed conduit as a treatment for constipation The Food and Drug Administration has ruled that colonic irrigation equipment is not approved for sale for the purpose of general wellbeing and has taken action against many distributors of this equipment including a FDA Warning Letter
 Colon cleansing 


The same term is also used in alternative medicine where it may involve the use of substances mixed with water in order to Detoxification (alternative medicine)
Kelloggs enemas

In the late 19th century Dr John Harvey Kellogg made sure that the bowel of each and every patient was plied with water from above and below His favorite device was an enema machine ("just like one I saw in Germany") that could run fifteen gallons of water through a persons bowel in a matter of seconds Every water enema was followed by a pint of yogurt—half was eaten the other half was administered by enema "thus planting the protective germs where they are most needed and may render most effective service" The yogurt served to replace "the intestinal flora" of the bowel creating what Kellogg claimed was a completely clean intestine

 Dangerous 

 Bleach enemas 

Chlorine dioxidePseudomedicine
Proponents falsely claim that administering autistic children these enemas results in the expulsion of parasitic worms ("rope worms") which actually are fragments of damaged intestinal epithelium that are misinterpreted as being human pathogens Oral and rectal use of the solution has also been promoted as a cure for HIV malaria viral hepatitis influenza common colds acne cancer Parkinsons disease
Chlorine dioxide is a potent and toxic bleach that is relabeled for "medicinal purposes" to a variety of brand names including but not limited to MMS Miracle Mineral Supplement and CD protocol For oral use the doses recommended on the labeling can cause nausea vomiting diarrhea and potentially lifethreatening dehydration

No clinical trials have been performed to test the health claims made for chlorine dioxide which originate from former Scientology
 Coffee enemas 


Well documented as having no proven benefits and considered by medical authorities as rash and potentially dangerous is an enema of coffee

A coffee enema can cause numerous maladies including infections sepsis (including campylobacter sepsis) severe Electrolyte disturbance
Gerson therapy includes administering enemas of coffee as well as of castor oil and sometimes of hydrogen peroxide or of ozone

Some proponents of alternative medicine have claimed that coffee enemas have an anticancer effect by "detoxifying" metabolic products of tumors but there is no medical scientific evidence to support this

 Recreational usage 

File:Inflatable enema nozzle in harness 01jpg
 Pleasure 

Enjoyment of enemas is known as klismaphilia which medically is classified as a paraphilia A person with klismaphilia is a klismaphile

Both women and men may enjoy sexual enema play heterosexually and homosexually experiencing sexual arousal from enemas which they find gratifying or sensual

Klismaphiles may perceive pleasure from a large water distended belly or the feeling of internal pressure An enema fetish may include the sexual attraction to the equipment processes environments situations or scenarios Klismaphiles can gain satisfaction of enemas through fantasies by actually receiving or giving one or through the process of eliminating steps to being administered one (eg under the pretence of being constipated)

That some women use enemas while masturbating was documented by Alfred Kinsey in Sexual Behavior in the Human Female: "There were still other masturbatory techniques which were regularly or occasionally employed by some 11 percent of the females in the sample Douches streams of running water vibrators urethral insertions enemas other anal insertions sadomasochistic activity and still other methods were occasionally employed but none of them in any appreciable number of cases"

 Other sexually related uses 
Besides klismaphilia the intrinsic enjoyment of enemas there are other uses of enemas in sexual play

 BDSM 

File:5000 ml Enema Bag with Dildo Nozzle Filled Hanging in Treejpg
Enemas are sometimes used in sadomasochism
 Rectal douching 

Another sexual use for enemas is to empty the rectum as a prelude to other anal sexual activities such as anal sex possibly reducing risk of infection

This is different from klismaphilia in which the enema is enjoyed for itself and as a part of sexual arousal and gratification

Rectal douching is a common practice among people who take a receptive role in anal sex although rectal douching before anal sex may increase the risk of transferring HIV hepatitis B and other diseases

 Intoxication 

Noting that deaths have been reported from alcohol poisoning via enemas an alcohol enema can be used to very quickly instill alcohol into the bloodstream absorbed through the membranes of the colon However great care must be taken as to the amount of alcohol used Only a small amount is needed as the intestine absorbs the alcohol far more quickly than the stomach

Preceding an enema for administration of drugs or alcohol a cleansing enema may first be used for cleaning the colon to help increase the rate of absorption

 Religious rituals 

All across Mesoamerica ritual enemas were employed to consume psychoactive substances eg balché alcohol (drug)
With historical roots in the Indian subcontinent enemas in Ayurveda called Basti (Panchakarma)
 Punitive usage 

Enemas have also been forcibly applied as a means of punishment

In the Guantanamo Bay detention campTorture
 In arts and literature 
 Written literature 

In the Theatre of Dionysus
In Shakespeares play Othello (Act II Scene I) Iago says "Yet again your fingers to your lips? would they were clysterpipes for your sake!"

In Miguel de Cervantes
In the 17th century satirists made physicians a favorite target resembling Molières caricature whose prescription for anything was "clyster bleed purge" or "purge bleed clyster"

In Molières play The Imaginary Invalid Argan a severe hypochondriac is addicted to enemas as indicated by such lines as when Bĕralde asks "Cant you be one moment without a purge?"

In George Orwells novel Nineteen EightyFour the narrator notes "Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation like having an enema"

In Grace Metaliouss novel Peyton Place (novel)
In Flora Rheta Schreibers book Sybil (Schreiber book)
In Anne Roiphes novel Torch Song Marjorie not knowing how to otherwise address her dysphonia reminisces on unhappy memories one of which is her German nurse inflicting on her painful enemas

 Monument 

A  brass statue of a syringe enema bulb held aloft by three cherubs stands in front of the "Mashuk" spa in the settlement of Zheleznovodsk in Russia Inspired by the 15th century Renaissance painter Botticelli it was created by a local artist who commented that "An enema is an unpleasant procedure as many of us may know But when cherubs do it its all right" When unveiled on 19 June 2008 posted on one of the spas wall was a banner declaring "Lets beat constipation and sloppiness with enemas"  The spa lying in the Caucasus Mountains region known for dozens of spas that routinely treat digestive and other complaints with enemas of mineral spring water the director commented "An enema is almost a symbol of our region" It is the only known monument to the enema
