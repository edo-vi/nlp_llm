The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG) is a group of scientific researchers who have conducted a series of clinical trials of treatments for prostate cancer The group was founded in 1981 and the first study SPCG1 began in 1984

Clinical trials
The studies conducted by the SPCG include the following:

 SPCG1 – estramustine phosphate versus diethylstilbestrol for highrisk advanced prostate cancer
 SPCG2 – orchiectomy plus cyproterone acetate versus placebo for metastatic prostate cancer
 SPCG3 – cancelled
 SPCG4 – radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for localized prostate cancer
 SPCG5 – polyestradiol phosphate versus triptorelin or orchiectomy plus flutamide for advanced prostate cancer
 SPCG6 – bicalutamide monotherapy versus standard care (watchful waiting) for localized prostate cancer
 SPCG7 – endocrine therapy with versus without radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer SPCG8 – cancelled
 SPCG9 – cancelled
 SPCG10 – cancelled
 SPCG11 (Zometa European Study ZEUS) – zoledronic acid with standard prostate cancer therapy versus standard prostate cancer therapy alone for prevention of bone metastasis SPCG12 – docetaxel versus surveillance after radical prostatectomy without androgen deprivation therapy for highrisk localized prostate cancer
 SPCG13 – docetaxel versus surveillance after radical prostatectomy with androgen deprivation therapy for highrisk localized prostate cancer
 SPCG14 – docetaxel versus bicalutamide for prostatespecific antigen cancer recurrence SPCG15 – radical prostatectomy versus radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer

The SPCG6 study was also known as Trial 25 of the Early Prostate Cancer (clinical programme)
Other work
The SPCG also published a 1997 literature review on combined androgen blockade for advanced prostate cancer
