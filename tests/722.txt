The removal of Indonesia as 2023 FIFA U20 World Cup
 Background  
Indonesia was awarded the hosting rights for the 2023 FIFA U20 World Cup in October 2019 beating bids from Brazil Peru and a joint bid from Myanmar and Thailand It was the first time that Indonesia would host a FIFA tournament and the second time that Southeast Asia would host the U20 World Cup after Malaysia in 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship
Indonesia planned to use six venues across six provinces for the tournament namely: Kapten I Wayan Dipta Stadium in Gianyar Regency; Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta; Jalak Harupat Stadium in Bandung; Gelora Bung Tomo Stadium in Surabaya; Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium in Palembang; Manahan Stadium in Surakarta The stadiums were originally scheduled to be completed by December 2020 but were delayed due to the COVID19 pandemic

 Controversy  
The controversy over Israel’s participation in the tournament emerged when Israel qualified as one of the five representatives of UEFA the European football confederation after finishing second in their group at the 2022 UEFA European Under19 Championship Indonesia which has the largest Muslim population in the world and does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian independence and has often criticized Israel’s policies and actions in the region The issue sparked protests and statements from various local officials and groups in Indonesia who called for the banning of Israel from the tournament or the withdrawal of Indonesia as the host Some of them cited the preamble to the Constitution of Indonesia
 FIFA sanctions 
After Indonesia lost its hosting rights for the U20 World Cup FIFA also imposed a provisional restriction on the use of FIFA Forward development funds for PSSI FIFA Forward is a program that provides financial and technical support for soccer development projects in each member association and confederation FIFA said it would review the sanction after evaluating Indonesia’s plan to improve its football

PSSI chief Erick Thohir said the sanction would affect PSSIs operational needs and reiterated President Joko Widodo’s instruction to transform the sport including renovating over 20 stadiums He also said Indonesia could avoid a more severe penalty of being banned from world soccer and that this was more like a yellow card than a red card

The cancellation of the Under20 World Cup caused anger and disappointment among fans and players in Indonesia FIFA made the decision after PSSI canceled the draw because the governor of Bali refused to host Israel’s team In March protesters marched in Jakarta waving Indonesian and Palestinian flags stating that Israel should not be allowed to participate

 Opposition to Israel’s participation  
Several groups and individuals in Indonesia expressed their opposition to Israel’s participation in the FIFA U20 World Cup which was originally scheduled to be held in Indonesia from May 20 to June 11 2023 Indonesia a Muslimmajority nation of more than 270 million people does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and anti Zionism
 Bali governor’s request  
One of the main sources of opposition came from I Wayan Koster the governor of Bali one of the six host provinces for the tournament Koster sent a letter to Indonesia’s sports ministry in early March 2023 requesting that Israel be banned from competing in Bali He cited the "humanitarian tragedy" in Palestine and the "violation of human rights" by Israel as reasons for his objection After the tournament was moved out of Indonesia Koster alternated between angrily stating that the Israelboycott movement was directed by more powerful (unnamed) leaders than himself and whining that FIFA should have banned Israel from its competitions and resolved things that way

 Public protests 
Koster’s request was supported by some conservative Muslim groups and activists who staged protests in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta on March 20 and March 29 They carried signs and chanted slogans demanding that the government prevent Israel from participating in the tournament They also accused FIFA of being biased and unfair in allowing Israel to qualify for the first time Some protesters also burned Israeli flags and effigies of former Israeli Prime Minister of Israel
 Government response  
President Joko Widodo addressed the nation on March 28 reiterating Indonesia’s support for the Palestinians but also stressing the country’s obligation to follow FIFA regulations He said that Indonesia had gone through a long bidding process to host the tournament and that it was an honor for the Indonesian people He also urged Indonesians to respect the spirit of sportsmanship and not mix politics with sports However his appeal failed to convince FIFA which announced on March 29 that it had removed Indonesia as the host of the tournament due to the current circumstances FIFA also said that sanctions against PSSI were possible
