A biological rule or biological law is a generalized law (science)
From the birth of their science biologists have sought to explain apparent regularities in observational data. In Aristotles biologyThere is some scepticism among biogeographers about the usefulness of general rules. For example J.C. Briggs in his 1987 book Biogeography and Plate Tectonics comments that while Willi Hennigs rules on cladistics "have generally been helpful" his progression rule is "suspect".

List of biological rules

* Allens rule states that the body shapes and proportions of endotherms vary by climatic temperature by either minimizing exposed surface area to minimize heat loss in cold climates or maximizing exposed surface area to maximize heat loss in hot climates. It is named after Joel Asaph Allen who described it in 1877.<ref>cite book  * Batesons rule states that extra legs are mirror-symmetric with their neighbours such as when an extra leg appears in an insects leg socket. It is named after the pioneering geneticist William Bateson who observed it in 1894. It appears to be caused by the leaking of positional signals across the limb-limb interface so that the extra limbs polarity is reversed.
* Bergmanns rule states that within a broadly distributed taxonomic clade populations and species of larger size are found in colder environments and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions. It applies with exceptions to many mammals and birds. It was named after Carl Bergmann (anatomist)* Copes rule states that animal population Lineage (evolution)* Deep-sea gigantism noted in 1880 by Henry Nottidge Moseley states that deep-sea animals are larger than their shallow-water counterparts. In the case of marine crustaceans it has been proposed that the increase in size with depth occurs for the same reason as the increase in size with latitude (Bergmanns rule): both trends involve increasing size with decreasing temperature.
File:Dollos law of irreversibility.svg * Dollos law of irreversibility proposed in 1893 by France* Eichlers rule states that the taxonomic diversity of parasites co-varies with the diversity of their hosts. It was observed in 1942 by Wolfdietrich Eichler and is named for him.File:Bombus bohemicus - Keila.jpg * Emerys rule noticed by Carlo Emery states that insect social parasitism (biology)* Fosters rule the island rule or the island effect states that members of a species get smaller or bigger depending on the resources available in the environment. The rule was first stated by J. Bristol Foster in 1964 in the journal Nature (journal)* Competitive exclusion principle* Glogers rule states that within a species of Warm-blooded* Haldanes rule states that if in a species hybrid (biology)* Hamiltons rule states that genes should increase in frequency when the relatedness of a recipient to an actor multiplied by the benefit to the recipient exceeds the reproductive cost to the actor. This is a prediction from the theory of kin selection formulated by W. D. Hamilton.
* Harrisons rule states that parasite body sizes co-vary with those of their hosts. He proposed the rule for louse* Hennigs progression rule states that when considering a group of species in cladistics the species with the most primitive characters are found within the earliest part of the area which will be the center of origin of that group. It is named for Willi Hennig who devised the rule.
* Jordans rule states that there is an inverse relationship between water temperature and meristic characteristics such as the number of fin rays vertebrae or scale numbers which are seen to increase with decreasing temperature. It is named after the father of American ichthyology David Starr Jordan.File:Sykora02.jpg * Lacks principle proposed by David Lack states that "the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can on average provide enough food". 
* Rapoports rule states that the latitude* Renschs rule states that across animal species within a lineage sexual size dimorphism increases with body size when the male is the larger sex and decreases as body size increases when the female is the larger sex. The rule applies in primates pinnipeds (seals) and even-toed ungulates (such as cattle and deer). It is named after Bernhard Rensch who proposed it in 1950.
* Schmalhausens law named after Ivan Schmalhausen states that a population at the extreme limit of its tolerance in any one aspect is more vulnerable to small differences in any other aspect. Therefore the variance of data is not simply noise interfering with the detection of so-called "main effects" but also an indicator of stressful conditions leading to greater vulnerability.
* Thorsons rule states that benthic marine invertebrates at low latitudes tend to produce large numbers of eggs developing to pelagic (often planktotrophic <nowiki>plankton-feeding</nowiki>) and widely dispersing larvae whereas at high latitudes such organisms tend to produce fewer and larger lecithotrophic (yolk-feeding) eggs and larger offspring often by viviparity or ovoviviparity which are often brooded. It was named after Gunnar Thorson by S. A. Mileikovsky in 1971.multiple image
          
* Van Valens law states that the probability of extinction for species and higher taxa (such as families and orders) is constant for each group over time; groups grow neither more resistant nor more vulnerable to extinction however old their lineage is. It is named for the evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen.
* von Baers laws (embryology)* Willistons law first noticed by Samuel Wendell Williston states that parts in an organism tend to become reduced in number and greatly specialized in function. He had studied the dentition of vertebrates and noted that where ancient animals had mouths with differing kinds of teeth modern carnivores had incisors and canines specialized for tearing and cutting flesh while modern herbivores had large molars specialized for grinding tough plant materials.
