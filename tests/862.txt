In the 2018–19 season before her international debut recordings of Valievas short program set to Spiegel im Spiegel by Arvo Pärt and inspired by Pablo Picassos painting Girl on a Ball received worldwide attention Tutberidze described it as her favorite program of the year The program also drew the notice of Picassos granddaughter Diana Widmaier Picasso who invited Valieva to visit her in Paris Among other victories that season she won the Russian Younger Age Championships ahead of training mates Sofia Akatieva and Sofia Samodelkina It was later announced that Valieva would keep her short program for her international debut in the upcoming season

One month later at the ISU Junior Grand Prix in Russia
Before the 2019–20 Junior Grand Prix Final in December a minor injury prevented Valieva from training the quadruple toe loop jump She entered the final as a cofavorite for the title along with Alysa Liu of the United States After placing fourth in the short program Valieva delivered a clean free skate to take the title ahead of Liu who dropped from first place in the short program after underrotating a triple Axel jump
At 13 years old Valieva was too young to enter the 2020 Russian Figure Skating Championships
The 2020 World Junior Championships were again seen by many as a showdown between Valieva and Liu who had recently defended her title at the seniorlevel 2020 US Figure Skating Championships

Making her senior 2021–22 ISU Grand Prix of Figure SkatingValievas results qualified her to the 2021–22 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final
On 24 December Valieva placed first in the short program at the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships
Selected as the Russian entry in the womens segments of the Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Team event
During the short program in the Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Womens singles
On 25–27 March Valieva participated in 2022 Channel One Trophy a Russian domestic competition During the short program she did not perform any triple axle as she always did; instead she cleanly jumped a double axle and scored 8363 into first place During free skating Valieva cleanly jumped a quadruple toeloop and scored 17388 in the second place behind Anna Shcherbakova

 2022–2023 season 
Russian and Belarusian athletes remained banned from international events for the 2022–23 figure skating season so the Russian Figure Skating Federation hosted its own domestic Grand Prix series Valieva was scheduled for the first Grand Prix event the Golden Skate of Moscow In the free skate she fell on a quadruple toe loop but she still won the gold medal ahead of Sofia Akateva and Anastasiya Zinina She then competed at the Grand Prix stage in her hometown Kazan and won another gold medal She then competed at the 2023 Russian Figure Skating Championships
On 13 January 2023 the Russian AntiDoping Agency (RUSADA) stripped Valieva of her gold medal in senior womens singles of the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships stemming from her positive test for trimetazidine a List of drugs banned by the World AntiDoping Agency
Official probe into allegations of doping and misconduct
Ostensibly a matter of allegations concerning misconduct by Valieva began on 25 December 2021 when Valieva submitted a routine urine sample for analysis following her win at the Russian Nationals on 24 December The normal 20day testing time for the sample lapsed apparently due to COVID19 related backlogs at the testing laboratory; however the positive doping test results were eventually forwarded for evaluation in February 2022 after the Beijing Olympics had started and the Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Team event
During Beijing Olympics
The medal ceremony for the team event in which the ROC won gold was originally scheduled for 8 February but was delayed over what International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required "legal consultation" with the International Skating Union (ISU) Several media outlets reported on 9 February that the issue was a positive test by Valieva for the banned substance trimetazidine The sample in question was taken by the Russian AntiDoping Agency (RUSADA) at the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25 December 2021 On 8 February 2022 the urine sample tested positive for traces of trimetazidine The sample was analyzed at the Doping Control Laboratory at Stockholms Karolinska University Hospital a World AntiDoping Agency (WADA)accredited lab The test result came one day after the team event concluded

Valieva was given a provisional suspension after her positive result but was cleared on appeal by RUSADAs independent Disciplinary AntiDoping Committee (DAC) on 9 February just a day later Due to Valieva being a minor at the time and thus classified as a "protected person" under WADA guidelines RUSADA and the IOC announced on 12 February that they would broaden the scope of their respective investigations to include members of her entourage such as coaches and team doctors Following formal appeals lodged by the IOC the ISU and WADA to review RUSADA DACs decision the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) heard the case on 13 February ahead of her scheduled appearance in the womens singles event beginning 15 February On 13 February Valievas mother testified at the CAS hearing that Valieva took hypoxen for heart "variations" According to an IOC representative Valieva herself argued at the hearing that the positive test result was "due to contamination with her grandads medicine"
On 14 February the CAS declined to reinstate Valievas provisional suspension and ruled that she would be allowed to compete in the womens singles event The CAS decided that preventing her from competing "would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances" while noting that any medals won by Valieva at the Beijing Olympics would be withheld pending the results of the continuing investigation into her doping violation The accommodating decision from the court subject to further and ongoing investigation was made on three grounds: due to her age she was a "protected person" per WADA code subject to different rules than adult athletes; she "did not test positive during the Olympic Games in Beijing"; and "There were serious issues of untimely notification of the results  which impinged upon the Athletes ability to establish certain legal requirements for her benefit" The IOC announced that the medal ceremony for the team event would not take place until the investigation concluded as there is a concrete decision whether to strip Valieva and the ROC of their medals

On 15 February after placing first in the Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Womens singles
File:Thomas Bach (13951010204)jpgIn a press conference the day after the free skate IOC president Thomas Bach said he was "very very disturbed" by the "chilling atmosphere" surrounding Valieva during the free skate as coach Eteri Tutberidze berated her following a mistakefilled performance that dropped her off the podium Bach also insinuated that her coaches likely played a role in her positive test President Vladimir Putins Government of Russia
IOC President Bach later added that "doping is very rarely done alone with the athletes" and that the "ones who have administered this drug in her body these are the ones who are guilty" WADA also filed an interim brief indicating that Valievas acknowledgment of taking the two permitted substances Hypoxen and Lcarnitine could be read as undercutting her testimony that the banned substance trimetazidine was ingested by error However Valievas eligibility has since been rescinded by the ISU although for an unrelated reason as all Russian and Belarusian skaters were banned due to the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine
After Beijing Olympics
By 9 March 2022 Travis Tygart of the USADA reported that Valieva had not requested that her "B" sample be tested apparently accepting the results of initial testing and relying on her explanation that the banned substance TMZ belonged to her grandfather and only accidentally contaminated or became mixed into her own use of allowed nutrients and supplements Tygart further stated that as a minor Valieva could still be either fully exculpated or given a warning concerning her testing positive depending on the extent of findings in the ongoing RUSADA investigation of doping According to Tygart an adverse finding against her as a first offense could still be assessed as a twoyear suspension which is half of the suspension time which could be assessed for adults On 17 March WADA requested that RUSADA complete its report on Valieva and her entourage by 8 August 2022 On 7 June 2022 ISU regulation governing the minimum age for competition at figure skating events was raised from 15 to 17 years of age following the Valieva incident at the Beijing Olympics

On 8 August insidethegames wrote that the sixmonth report originally expected on 8 August would be allowed some extra time because further data was requested by RUSADA in July in order to complete its report stating that: "WADA President Witold Bańka recently told insidethegames that he expects a hearing will be held by RUSADA quite soon and that the organization will monitor it" On 15 September Christine Brennan writing for USA Today indicated that RUSADA had completed their report and delivered it for evaluation and subsequent scheduling of official hearings concerning the investigation of Valievas possible misconduct regarding the use of banned substances during competition Brennan further quoted US AntiDoping CEO Travis Tygart stating that: “Given it appears that RUSADAs investigation is over and the case is now headed to court they must have found sufficient evidence of a violation or otherwise the case would be closed and WADA would be notified of its right to appeal" A disciplinary hearing reviewing the Rusada investigation results is presently planned to take place in late September or early October Travis Tygart the CEO of the US AntiDoping Agency stated that <blockquote>"If she is exonerated there is nothing to hide and it should be made public Certainly keeping the decision and facts secret make a mockery of the whole process and there is no wonder athletes and the public do not trust the global WADA antidoping system Short of this it’s impossible for athletes or the public to believe what happened at the 2022 Beijing Games was real and not just another fraudulent win by the Russians like so many before as the evidence has clearly shown"</blockquote> 

Evan Bates and Nathan Chen criticized the lack of transparency in the review of the Valieva case as creating an undue delay for the presentation of the Olympic medals which were withheld for more than a year as of March 2023 from being awarded until the results of the Valieva case are fully resolved to determine if Russia ought to keep the gold medal or be stripped of it Although Russia as a country is currently banned from participating in international skating events due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Valieva has continued to compete within Russian borders without being hindered by RUSADA as recently as the Russian Grand Prix held in October 2022 In midNovember WADA requested that CAS take up the review of the Valieva case with an eye towards a 4year suspension of Valieva which would exclude her from competition at the next Winter Olympics and to rescind her first place performance at the previous Beijing Olympics because "the Russian AntiDoping Agency (RUSADA) did not meet a WADAimposed Nov 4 deadline to deliver a verdict on Valievas case" On 13 January Valieva was denied her gold medal in Senior Womens singles of the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships following a ruling by RUSADA stating that her positive drug test was coincident with the December 2021 competition while her win for team Russia at the Beijing Olympics in February 2022 was endorsed as valid following her passing drug tests in Beijing; WADA has stated that it will continue to press its request for CAS to review RUSADAs decision concerning the positive drug test In March 2023 Graham Dunbar writing for AP stated that CAS was in the process of selecting a 3judge panel which should decide upon the question of either allowing or suspending Valieva from competition at the next Winter Olympics based on their investigation On June 22 2023 CAS announced that the hearing in the doping case was scheduled to take place September 26—29 2023 On September 28 CAS "ordered the production of further documentation" and announced that her hearing had been adjourned until November 910 It appeared that one of the parties in the case requested a file that had not previously been a part of the proceedings
