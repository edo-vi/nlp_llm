A nasal vaccine is a vaccine administered through the nose that stimulates an immune response without an injection It induces immunity through the Nasal mucosa
History
Nasal inoculation dates as far back as the 17th century in China during the Kangxi Emperor’s reign Documentation during this period indicates that the Kangxi Emperor vaccinated his family army and others for mild smallpox Manuals detailing vaccination techniques at the time all focused on sending smallpox up the nose of the individual being vaccinated Although other vaccination techniques were developed using an infected individual’s scabs a common method was to place a cotton swab with the fluid from an infected person’s pustule up the nose

Following smallpox influenza became a prominent focus for nasal vaccine development The first Live attenuated influenza vaccineInfobox medical intervention

Anthrax attacks at the beginning of the 21st century caused a demand for nasal vaccine development As anthrax is an airborne substance that can be inhaled a nasal vaccine has the potential to be used to protect individuals from the effects it can have on the respiratory system Following the September 11 attacks
The COVID19 pandemic
Administration
Nasal vaccines are a subsection of mucosal immunization as they use a mucosal route for vaccine delivery As many pathogens can enter the body through the nose nasal vaccines take advantage of this mechanism to deliver the vaccine The nose has multiple lines of defense to prevent pathogens from entering further into the body Nasal hairs are the first defense as they are at the entrance of the nose and prevent large particles from entering The mucus layer in the nasal cavity can trap smaller particles that get past the nose hairs The nasal cavity has a large vascularization network so particles can go through the epithelial layer and directly enter the bloodstream Intruding particles will interact with the mucosal immune system if they reach the nasal mucosa The mucosal immune system is composed of lymphoid tissue B cells T cells and antigenpresenting cells These different types of cells work together to identify intruding particles and trigger an immune response 

Nasal vaccines can come in different forms such as solutions (liquids) powders gels and solid inserts The most prevalent type of nasal vaccine in research and clinical application is solutions due to its ease of use Although solutions are usually pipetted into test subjects’ nostrils when conducting animal trials for nasal vaccines nasal sprays are considered the most practical approach for mass human vaccination using nasal vaccines The antigen in the nasal vaccine can then trigger an immune response and prevent infection due to nasal vaccines’ accessibility to the immune system 
File:Nose AnatomypngNasal sprays are commonly used for delivering drugs in addition to vaccines Decongestant drugs are often directly delivered to the nose through nasal sprays Cold and allergy medication can be administered using nasal sprays for local delivery by bypassing nasal hairs and being introduced to the nasal cavity Intranasal administration can have less drug degradation compared to oral administration because of direct particle delivery Peptide drugs used for hormone treatments can be delivered nasally through nasal sprays instead of orally to retain particle integrity Nasal sprays can also be used to deliver diabetes treatment steroids and intranasal oxytocin to induce labor Nasal administration is also used to deliver anesthetics and sedatives due to direct access to the mucosal immune system and bloodstream 

The olfactory epithelium makes up approximately 7% of the surface area of the nasal cavity and is connected to the olfactory bulb in the brain Drugs and vaccines can be delivered to the brain past the Blood–brain barrier
Compared to injectable vaccines nasal vaccines can be advantageous because they are safe painless and easy to use Nasal vaccines do not require a needle which eliminates pain from needlestick injuries and safety concerns due to crosscontamination and needle disposal Some studies also show that intranasal vaccines can generate crossreactive antibodies that could lead to crossprotection

Live attenuated influenza vaccine
The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in the form of a nasal spray was one of the first nasal vaccines released on the market Nasal spray LAIVs have been used since the late 1980s as an alternative to the injectable influenza vaccine All nasal LAIVs for recent flu seasons (20222023) are considered quadrivalents because “they are designed to protect against four types of flu viruses: an influenza A(H1N1) virus an influenza A(H3N2) virus and two influenza B viruses” Although injectable and nasal LAIVs are presented as options for yearly vaccination against influenza FluMist was pulled off of the United States market from 2016 to 2018 due to its inefficiency against a common influenza strain in children Since then FluMist has been reformulated and has reentered the market File:Fluenz Tetra for 2020  21 seasonjpg
Intranasal COVID19 Vaccines
Prior to the 2020 global COVID19 pandemic animal studies in 2004 on African green monkeys tested a SARSassociated coronavirus (SARSCoV) vaccine and showed that these monkeys did not emit the virus from their upper respiratory tract after being infected Since then several intranasal COVID19 vaccines have been developed with the onset of the COVID19 pandemic INCOVACCFile:SARSCoV2 without backgroundpngIn August 2020 during the COVID19 pandemic studies in mice and monkeys demonstrated that protection from the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
India and China approved INCOVACC
 Applications to veterinary medicine 
Species other than humans use nasal vaccines to prevent diseases Intranasal vaccines are used on dogs for Bordetella bronchiseptica to prevent Kennel coughFile:Bordetella bronchisepticajpgCattle receive nasal vaccines against diseases such as Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1
Recent discoveries indicate that rainbow trout have a previously unknown lymphoid structure in their nasal cavity This structure allows them to have fast innate and adaptive responses to nasal vaccines

Research 
File:Nasal Spray (46057881342)jpgCurrent research is exploring new technologies and developments to improve nasal vaccine delivery methods Particle size and characteristics have become a focus of research as smaller particles can travel more easily to reach the epithelial layer of the nasal cavity compared to larger particles Nanoparticles and nanosystems are being researched to optimize nasal delivery Coated nanoparticles are an area of focus due to their properties to induce immune effects Glycol chitosancoated nanoparticles induced more of an immune response compared to the other types of nanoparticles Nanocarriers designed based on the characteristics of the nasal epithelium can be used to deliver nasal vaccines and can therefore make nasal vaccination more accessible Polymeric nanosystems are also being developed to deliver vaccines to target sites while preventing them from degrading; current research is focused on understanding the material and physical properties of biodegradable materials to be used in nanosystems to improve vaccine efficacy Research on the movement of nasal vaccine particles is focused on developing more effective ways for these vaccines to enter the body An animal study on mice tested how a nasal vaccine can bypass issues with entry into the nasal epithelium by taking advantage of ciliary movement The results indicated that tubulin tyrosine ligaselike family member 1 (Ttll1) knockout mice had higher levels of the vaccine antigen compared to the hetero mice
