In the late 20th and early 21st century scholars have used newly excavated archeological evidence to argue that some particular elements of ancient Chinese civilization were carried from western or central Asia into China and that there are linguistic ties between the two sides of the Asian continent

Lacouperies theory
The French Sinologist Albert Terrien de Lacouperie (1845–94) presented extensive and detailed arguments  in The Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization from 2300&nbsp;BC to 200&nbsp;AD (1892) that Chinese civilization had been founded by Babylonian immigrants  He wrote:
::Everything in Chinese antiquity and traditions points to a western origin No Sinologist who has studied the subject has been able to ascertain any other origin for the Chinese than one from the West It is through the NW of China proper that they have gradually invaded the country and that their present greatness began from very small beginnings some forty centuries ago
Lacouperie claimed that the Yellow Emperor  was an historical Mesopotamian tribal leader who led a massive migration of his people into China around 2300&nbsp;BC and founded what later became Chinese civilization He further claimed a similarity between the trigrams and hexagrams in the ancient Chinese text the I Ching
These theories of the Mesopotamian origins of Chinese civilization were supported by the Assyriologist Archibald Sayce in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society They impressed the public but were criticised or dismissed by sinologists then and later James Legge whose stilladmired translations of the Chinese Classics appeared at the same time as Lacouperies questioned Lacouperies sinological competence Legges review of Terriens translation of the I Ching charged that only "hasty ignorance" could have led to the mistakes in the translation which included failing to consult the basic reference the Kangxi Dictionary Another reviewer labelled Lacouperie a "specious wondermonger" But the final blow to Lacouperies comparativist theories came when the  University of Leiden sinologist Gustav Schlegel dismissed his claims and  insisted on the independent origin and autonoumous growth of Chinese civilisation Schlegel set the tone for later Orientalists Scholars went on to point out that monosyllabic Chinese characters could not be equated to polysyllabic Chaldean words used in Bablylon; that in any case knowledge of ancient Assyria was "dangerously uncertain" and too unreliable to make such claims; and that it had not even been established that Babylonian civilization was earlier than Chinese

Lacouperies theory on the Babylonian origins of the Chinese sixty year ganzhi cyclical calendar system fared little better Scholars pointed out that the two systems differed both in concept and function: the Babylonian decimal system was used to count up to 60 where the cycle started again while the Chinese system combined a cycle of twelve and a cycle of ten

Reception of Lacouperie in Asia
The theory of a Western origin for Chinese civilization reached Japan and was introduced into China in an extensive summary in Chinese by Shirakawa Jiro(白河次郞) and Kokubu Tanenori(國府種德) which omitted the academic refutation The theory was known as Xilai Shuo (西来说)  European sinologists found Lacouperies evidence flimsy and reasoning faulty but these criticisms were omitted from the 1900 presentation of Lacouperies views which seemed the most advanced Western scholarship on China  Chinese scholars of the time were eager to find ancient roots for the Chinese nation and to believe that the Yellow Emperor and other ancient figures were historical not mythical They were quickly attracted by "the historicization of Chinese mythology" that the two Japanese authors advocated

Some Chinese revolutionary nationalists welcomed Lacouperies picture of the Han race as ancient and civilized in contrast to the Manchus who had conquered China They interpreted Lacouperie as supporting their antiManchuism
In the 1920s the discovery of Neolithic sites revived interest in Western connections with Chinese civilization Scholars such as Gu Jiegang successfully attacked Lacouperies theories and their Chinese supporters but the Yellow Emperor retained his appeal as the progenitor of the Han race

Later theories
Scholars remained skeptical of SinoBabylonianism in its original or narrow form but continued to explore the idea of the mixture of indigenous and panEurasian elements in early Chinese culture Ellsworth Huntington and Carl Whiting BishopAdvocacy of hyperdiffusionism
The scholars JP Mallory and  Victor Mair made a Tarim mummiesArguments for cultural transmission from West to East
The Sinologist John Didier made an extensive investigation of what he calls the "interactive Eurasian world c 9000–500 BC" that is the mutual ties between ancient East Asia South Asia and the MiddleEast including Persia and Babylon These exchanges he argues shaped the foundations and early evolution of East Asian technology cosmology religion myth rulership divination and literacy Didier provides examples of the Middle Eastern origin or inspiration of astronomical systems and calendars religious figures such as the Yellow Emperor and religious myths based on astrological observation shared across the continent

In 2016 Sun Weidong(孙卫东) a Chinese geochemist argued that the founders of Chinese civilization migrated from Egypt and were therefore not actually Chinese He was led to this hypothesis when his radiometric dating of ancient Chinese bronzes found that their chemical composition was more similar to ancient Egyptian bronzes than to ores found in China Sun went on to argue that the technology of Bronze Age widely thought to have come across Central Asia by land had in fact been brought by the Hyksos a Levantine people who settled in the Nile Valley in the 17th and 16th centuries BC and may have fled by sea when their dynasty collapsed The technologies that the Hyskos had earlier developed—bronze metallurgy chariots literacy domesticated plants and animals—were precisely those that have been excavated at the Shang dynasty capital Yinxu
