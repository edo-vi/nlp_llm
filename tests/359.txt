The split in darts refers to the acrimonious dispute between top professional darts players and the games governing body the British Darts Organisation (BDO) In 1993 16 top players disillusioned by the BDOs running of the sport and its inability to reverse the decline in television coverage and sponsorship left the BDO and created a breakaway darts circuit under the banner of the World Darts Council (WDC)

The BDO responded by imposing a worldwide ban on the rebel players and anyone who associated with them A costly four year legal battle ensued culminating in a compromise Tomlin Order in 1997 The BDO lifted the ban and formally recognised the WDC and the right of players to freely participate in darts competitions In return the WDC dropped its claim to being a world governing body and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation Thereafter each organisation had its own pool of players and tournaments and each staged its own version of the World Professional Darts Championship

The BDO folded into administration in October 2020 and the World Darts Federation took over control of BDO events so the split in darts remains The WDF subsequently established its own version of the World Darts Championship and the inaugural event took place in 2022

Background
The darts boom
The British Darts Organisation (BDO) was formed in 1973 by Olly Croft It gradually superseded the existing National Darts Association of Great Britain (NDAGB) as the governing body of darts in the UK and by the early 1980s had established a monopoly on organised darts in Britain running super league darts county darts and major tournaments including the annual World Championship The BDO became a founder member of the World Darts Federation in 1974 The BDO would preside over darts rise from a pub game to a worldwide sport

Darts first appeared on British television in May 1937 when the BBC broadcast a darts and shove hapenny competition from Alexandra Palace In 1962 Westward Television broadcast the Westward TV Invitational to the South West England
<blockquote>"Twelve thousand darts fans turn up at the Ally Pally drunk as skunks They cheer on their heroes just like a football crowd They have banners gonks rattles the lot It will be great telly"</blockquote>

The following year ITV commissioned The Indoor League a series presented by Fred Trueman and produced by Sid Waddell which showcased various indoor sports and games; one of its features was a darts tournament involving some of the worlds best players Initially only shown in the Yorkshire Television region it was broadcast throughout Britain on the ITV network from the second series onwards Its venue the Leeds Irish Centre was recognised in 2010 as "the birthplace of TV darts"
File:Crucible of Darts 16 August 2017jpgTelevised darts proliferated during the 1970s and 1980s ITV began covering the new World Masters (darts)
By 1983 there were 23 televised events Darts was also the centrepiece of a new gameshow Bullseye (British game show)
Decline
Darts players smoked and drank alcohol on stage a reflection of the games origins in pubs In 1980 this was mocked in a sketch on the satirical BBC comedy show Not the Nine OClock News The sketch features a match between two overweight darts players played by Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith but instead of throwing darts they take turns drinking shots of alcohol while a Geordie commentator (voiced by Rowan Atkinson) narrates the action ("single pint double vodka") as they get progressively more drunk The sketch is often blamed for damaging darts public image and reducing it to a laughing stock Eric Bristow felt it "didnt do the sport any favours especially with the media luvvies who ruled the BBC and the other channels" According to darts historian Patrick Chaplin it "indelibly seared the fat belly image of darts players into the minds of the nation forever"

In 1984 the BDO Gold Cup
Sid Waddell said "it was the yuppie era that did for us" He added: "they television executives thought the audience was all NRS social grade
While the decline of television coverage was partly due to policy changes at the BBC and ITV the BDO were also blamed for allowing the game to stagnate and not doing enough to improve its image The BDO banned smoking on stage during matches in 1988 which was followed soon afterwards by a ban on alcohol However it had little impact and more televised darts did not materialise As Bobby George put it: "It made no difference at all to the fading interest in the game They the BDO thought if beer and fags were banned everything in the garden would be rosy again but that didnt turn out to be the case"

Players unrest
Several players had longstanding grievances with the BDO and its running of darts such as why players had no say in how events were run and why players lost money when they played in international matches Players were not allowed to wear personal sponsors when playing in competitions but had to promote the BDOs sponsors When told by Olly Croft that "the BDO put you where you are today" Lowe replied: "Have you ever considered that I and the other professionals all helped to put the BDO where they are today?" Meetings were held in which the players aired their concerns but little changed

However there was no serious player unrest until darts popularity started to wane in the mid1980s As major tournaments disappeared this meant reduced prize money sponsorship and television exposure which in turn led to fewer bookings for exhibition matches They felt that not enough was being done by the BDO to encourage new sponsors and increase television coverage from more than one event per year Rod Harrington summarised the players issue: "The trouble with the BDO is that after the world championships and its great prize money there is virtually nothing The top players simply cant earn a living on one event"

Croft himself also received criticism Some players and managers resented the level of control he and the BDO had over darts; his attitude was variously described as "dictatorial" or "autocratic" In response to player concerns Croft said: "It’s like your children They say: ‘can I have an ice cream?’ and you say: ‘no’ We don’t owe anyone a living"

Another issue arose shortly after the 1992 BDO World Darts Championship
In December 1986 the Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA) was formed to represent the players but the BDO refused to recognise the body They wanted to appoint a public relations consultant to improve the image of the game and to get more tournaments on television The WDC staged their first televised event in October 1992 (the WDC UK Masters
According to Bristow he approached Croft on behalf of the WDC players shortly before the 1993 Embassy World Championship to air the players concerns

"No" he said

"OK" I replied Would you mind if we ran our own tournaments on TV because our livelihood is being affected here?"

"Yes I would mind" he said

"OK if we did run our own tournaments on television what would happen?"

"Youll be banned"

The 1993 World Championship
File:wdcbadgesjpgThe 1993 BDO World Darts Championship
On 7 January 1993 the 16 WDC players released a statement saying that they would only participate in the 1994 BDO World Darts Championship
The 16 WDC players who signed the 7 January 1993 statement were:

 Phil Taylor (darts player) Dennis Priestley
 Rod Harrington
 John Lowe (darts player) Alan Warriner
 Eric Bristow
 Jocky Wilson
 Bob Anderson (darts player) Peter Evison
 Jamie Harvey
 Ritchie Gardner
 Cliff Lazarenko
 Kevin Spiolek
 Keith Deller
 Mike Gregory (darts player) Chris Johns (darts player)
The list included every previous world darts champion with the exception of Leighton Rees the first world champion from 1978 who was not an active player when the split happened

Worldwide ban
BDO and WDF sanctions
On 25 April 1993 at a meeting in Finchley the BDO took the step of turning the suspension of the WDC players from playing in any BDOrun tournaments on British soil into a fullscale ban on the WDC players from being able to play any BDOsanctioned darts even down to county level The BDO also passed a motion which said that any BDO players who participated in exhibition events with WDC players would also be banned from the BDO The BDO passed the following motions at the 25 April 1993 Finchley meeting:

 Any British Darts Organisation official or British Darts Organisation player who is associated with the activities of the World Darts Council shall forfeit the right to organise attend or participate in any events under the jurisdiction of the British Darts Organisation or its members until written undertaking is given that they are no longer associated with the World Darts Council or its activities Motion passed by 57 votes for to 0 votes against
 All member counties shall refrain from attending or assisting in any exhibitions involving the 16 players named in the World Darts Council statement of 7 January 1993 any players who have affiliated to the World Darts Council since that date and any players who may affiliate to the World Darts Council in the future Motion passed by 54 votes for to 1 vote against
 All member counties shall exclude any players who are affiliated to the World Darts Council from darts events under their jurisdiction Motion passed by 60 votes for to 0 votes against

On 18 October 1993 at a WDF meeting in Las Vegas the BDO sought to have their bans on the WDC players officially ratified and set in stone on a world scale in the WDF rules and the Welsh WDF representative moved the motion that the WDC players be referred to as the "former top players" The motion passed by 24 votes for to 3 votes against

Two countries who voted against the motion at the Las Vegas meeting the United States of America
Player ban
The ban on the WDC players was enforced rigorously According to Sid Waddell "The BDOs use of the phrase associating with WDC people had become a licence for every little witchfinder in every nook and cranny of their organisation Whatever Croft and his allies in Muswell Hill intended between the Finchley meeting in spring 1993 and the precourt case proceedings in 1997 some terrible things were being reported" Pub teams were warned they faced a ban from competitions if their pubs hosted exhibitions by the rebel players; Phil Taylors cousin a Staffordshire county player was warned not to associate with him; some officials lost their jobs after taking part in WDC events WDC players were prevented from playing county matches One zealous BDO official tried to document members of the audience at a Rod Harrington exhibition so they could be banned"

Paul Lim was banned from WDF events after joining the WDC in 1994 Kevin Burrows a semiprofessional player who qualified for the WDCs inaugural 1994 World Championship was blacklisted from all levels of BDO darts for participating in the rebel tournament In 1997 Richie Burnett John Part and Alan Evans all received a ban from BDO competitions for playing in a special "Battle of the Champions" event broadcast on Sky Sports against WDC players Phil Taylor (darts player)
However the ban was not enforced universally and was not applied at all in America and Canada whose WDF delegates had voted against banning the WDC players Shayne Burgess who joined the WDC in 1994 claimed "the Canadians didnt give a toss about the split" and let him play in the Canadian Open (darts)
The rebels
File:Circus Tavern  Geograph3222467byDavidAnstissjpgAfter the worldwide ban was imposed the sixteen WDC players were "cast into the darting wilderness able to play only amongst themselves their future uncertain" Banned from the Embassy World Championship they resolved to stage their own version Moreover the emergence of satellite television gave them a new option: Sky Sports who had recently purchased the broadcast rights to English footballs new Premier League In 1993 Sky and the WDC announced an exclusive deal to broadcast the PDC World Darts Championship
But there was trouble ahead for the rebels Chris Johns (darts player)
Despite continued pressure and rumours of further defections the remaining 14 players held firm and the 1994 WDC World Darts Championship
Legal action and Tomlin Order
After the worldwide ban was imposed the WDC sued the BDO for lost earnings and restraint of trade They argued that the BDO enjoyed an unfair monopoly on organising events and that the BDOs actions were "unlawful and imposed unfairly in breach of the BDOs own rules" They further argued that the ban violated European Union law They also cited as a precedent Tony Greig and John Snow (cricketer)
On 30 June 1997 days before the case reached the High Court the BDO and the WDC representatives reached a compromise in the form of a Tomlin order The Guardian summarized: "the BDO lost its case" The judge agreed that the right of the WDC players to carry out of their profession as darts players had been unreasonably restricted The BDO lifted the worldwide ban on the WDC players recognized the WDC and its right to stage professional competitions and agreed that all players could freely participate in tournaments and exhibitions In return the WDC dropped their damages claim for loss of earnings and agreed to remove the word world from their name renaming themselves the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) The PDC recognized the WDF as the governing body for darts worldwide and the BDO the governing body for darts in the UK

Speaking afterwards Eric Bristow called it "a great day for the sport of darts" He added "for the first time in four years I am free to play darts in competitions all over the world this action was never about money but our freedom to play who we liked on a local or international level and where we liked" Olly Croft said he was "not disappointed" by the result He confirmed there would continue to be two world championships but "our champion will be champion of half a million players throughout the world Theirs will be champion of 20odd"

Player eligibility
After the Tomlin Order all darts players were eligible to enter any darts competition run by the PDC the BDO or the WDF From 19982001 some BDOaffiliated players competed in the PDCs World Matchplay (darts)
To play in a BDO / WDF tournament a player had to agree to comply with the rules of the Professional Darts CorporationTomlin order
In 2001 the PDC offered all Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA) members a oneyear contract to appear in the PDCs three televised major tournaments at the time: the World Championship the World Matchplay and the World Grand Prix Players who rejected the contract in order to compete in a different tournament would not be eligible to play in the remaining majors that year It effectively meant that players who wished to play in the Matchplay and the Grand Prix would also have to commit to playing in the PDC World Championship rather than the BDO version However any player could apply for PDPA membership and there would be no restrictions on entering other PDC events Entry to most PDC majors is now restricted to members of the PDPA

However there are notable exceptions PDPA Players Championships and Open events often allowed residents of the host country to participate regardless of being a PDPA member or not This leads to anomalies such as Michael van Gerwen winning the PDC Open Holland in 2006 whilst being a BDO player at the time

Another exception is made for major Dutch televised tournaments They were previously staged under BDO / WDF qualification rules but when the most famous Dutch player Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC the tournament organisers insisted on inviting PDC players An agreement was made with the BDO to allow a number of PDC wildcards for each event Three more top Dutch players joined the PDC in January 2007 which added more confusion to player eligibility rules for these events (see International Darts League and World Darts Trophy)

The Grand Slam of Darts (organised by the PDC) was the first major tournament staged in the United Kingdom to feature players from both sides of the darting divide Inaugurated in 2007 it also featured a return to darts broadcasting for ITV Network
Standing of organisations
Early years
The first WDC world championship in 1994 featured most of the top ranked darts players including seven former world champions Paul Haigh of the Sunday Telegraph wrote: "All the current top men except Mike Gregory are WDC and theres no getting away from that fact" The Independent agreed: "though the BDO event has much the greater pool of competitors it is the WDC event which involves just about every darts player you have ever heard of" However some of these players such as Jocky Wilson and Eric Bristow were considered past their prime by the 1990s Olly Croft insisted that most of the WDC players were "has beens" though in response John Lowe pointed out that he had been world champion in 1993

As BDO and PDCaffiliated players only faced each other infrequently the strength and standing of the two organisations was ambiguous Both organisations continued to claim that their world championship was the best version The PDC was generally felt to have the best players
but prior to the end of the legal action in June 1997 few players were willing to defy BDO sanctions and play in WDC events so they had to make up the numbers in their early tournaments with American players of varying quality and experience

Dan Waddell wrote: "for a number of years after the split and beyond the issue of which code was the strongest and which World Championship was best was a source of passionate debate among darts and sports fans In those first WDC worlds there is no doubt they had the finer more talented top eight most of whom would have been seeded in a unified game But where the BDO had the edge was in depth of talent: players who had qualified for the Embassy and were excellent performers in county and international darts who made the tournament tougher than the WDC equivalent for the higher seeds" Ned Boulting also thought there was "genuine parity" between the codes for the first decade after the split noting that while the PDC had some outstanding players it lacked strength in numbers

PDC vs BDO
Phil Taylor was generally regarded as the best player across both organisations in the 1990s and 2000s and by some as the greatest darts player ever In a special "Battle of the Champions" event in 1997 Taylor beat Richie Burnett the 1995 BDO champion 4–1 in sets The same card featured a match between the respective 1994 champions Dennis Priestley (PDC) and John Part (BDO) Priestley won 3–0 in sets In a 1999 faceoff dubbed "the match of the century" Taylor defeated Raymond van Barneveld the 1998 and 1999 BDO champion 21–10 in legs In 2004 Taylor defeated Andy Fordham the reigning BDO champion in another challenge match broadcast on Sky Sports payperview

In 2005 Taylor and van Barneveld both reigning world champions met again in the crosscode Masters of Darts semifinals; Taylor won 5–2 in sets In the group stages of the same event Taylor also beat Tony David the 2002 BDO champion 4–0 in sets and beat Fordham 7–1 in the final In 2006 and 2007 PDC players were invited to the BDO/WDFrun World Darts Trophy Taylor won 2006 World Darts Trophy
The PDCs Grand Slam of Darts established in 2007 was the first major darts tournament held in Britain to feature players from both the PDC and BDO In the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts
Players who moved from the BDO to the PDC enjoyed varied fortunes<ref>cite news
Widening gap and defections
In 2001 Barry Hearn became PDC chairman Under Hearns management the PDC Pro Tour was established and major televised tournaments such as the UK Open the Las Vegas Desert Classic the Grand Slam of Darts the Masters (darts)
Consequently a large number of the BDOs top players including most of its former champions List of darts players who have switched organisation
Meanwhile the BDO stagnated and began to lose ground to the PDC; annual profits stood at £16929 in 2008 compared with over £1 million for the PDC They were the subject of a failed takeover bid by the PDC in 2009 In 2011 the BDO board were criticized by the membership in an open letter for lagging behind the PDC in terms of sponsorship television coverage and new ideas Its perceived lower standard of play was also the subject of derision from some quarters In 2016 the BBC ended its coverage of the BDO World Championship replacing it with a new PDC tournament the Champions League of Darts

Dan Waddell wrote in 2016:

<blockquote>The Great Darts War is now over The PDC stands victorious Their "brand" sells out arenas designed to host stadiumswallowing rock bands they have the best players in the world under their banner and quickly attract the best newcomers from across the divide who see a chance to make money on the professional circuit The BDO continues to do a fine job promoting amateur darts but its professional game is lacklustre kept afloat only by Bob Potters largesse and some halfhearted BBC TV coverage Its a dated muted relic of the vibrant raucous tournament it once was The BDO try to offer their professionals and topend players tournaments and opportunities to compete but even they know the game is up and that the flow of talent to the PDC is a tide that cant be turned </blockquote>

PDC bid to take over BDO
On 21 October 2009 Barry Hearn made a bid of £1 million to purchase the BDO The offer included a further £1 million for grassroots darts A few months after the takeover offer and in the aftermath of the two organisations 2010 BDO World Darts Championship
 BDO lifting of PDC restrictions 
On 23 August 2018 under new chairman Des Jacklin the BDO made the decision to modify their eligibility rules All PDC tour card holders were now permitted to enter BDO events with the rule changes coming into effect on 1 October of the same year The decision was made to allow female players to enter the PDC Ladies playoffs (for two spots in the PDC World Championship) without the loss of status in the BDO This rule change also allows all players that compete in the BDO to enter the PDC QSchool without penalty The PDPA still retains all streaming/television restrictions on PDPA tour card holders in nonPDC sanctioned events
