In literature a serial is a printing or publishing format by which a single larger Creative work
Serialisation can also begin with a single short story that is subsequently turned into a series  Historically such series have been published in periodicals Popular shortstory series are often published together in book form as collections

 Early history 
The growth of moveable type in the 17th century prompted episodic and often disconnected narratives such as LAstrée and Artamène
 19th and early 20th centuries 
Serialised fiction surged in popularity during Britains Victorian era due to a combination of the rise of literacy technological advances in printing and improved economics of distribution Most Victorian novels first appeared as instalments in monthly or weekly periodicals The wild success of Charles Dickenss The Pickwick Papers first published in 1836 is widely considered to have established the viability and appeal of the serialised format within periodical literature  During that era the line between "quality" and "commercial" literature was not distinct Other famous writers who wrote serial literature for popular magazines were Wilkie Collins inventor of the detective fiction
While American periodicals first syndicated British writers over time they drew from a growing base of domestic authors The rise of the periodicals like Harpers Magazine
As a piece in Scribners Monthly explained in 1878 "Now it is the second or third rate novelist who cannot get publication in a magazine and is obliged to publish in a volume and it is in the magazine that the best novelist always appears first" Among the American writers who wrote in serial form were Henry James and Herman Melville A large part of the appeal for writers at the time was the broad audiences that serialisation could reach which would then grow their following for published works One of the first significant American works to be released in serial format is Uncle Toms Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe which was published over a 40week period by The National Era an abolitionist periodical starting with the June 5 1851 issue

Serialisation was so standard in American literature that authors from that era often built instalment structure into their creative process James for example often had his works divided into multipart segments of similar length The consumption of fiction during that time was different than in the 20th century Instead of being read in a single volume a novel would often be consumed by readers in instalments over a period as long as a year with the authors and periodicals often responding to audience reaction

In France Alexandre Dumas and Eugène Sue were masters of the serialised genre The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo each appeared as a feuilleton The Count of Monte Cristo was stretched out to 139 instalments Eugène Sues serial novel Le Juif errant increased circulation of Le Constitutionnel from 3600 to 25000 Production in book form soon followed and serialisation was one of the main reasons that nineteenthcentury novels were so long Authors and publishers kept the story going if it was successful since authors were paid by line and by episode Gustave Flauberts Madame Bovary was serialised in La Revue de Paris in 1856

Some writers were prolific Alexandre Dumas wrote at an incredible pace oftentimes writing with his partner twelve to fourteen hours a day working on several novels for serialised publication at once However not every writer could keep up with the serial writing pace Wilkie Collins for instance was never more than a week before publication The difference in writing pace and output in large part determined the authors success as audience appetite created a demand for further instalments

In the Germanspeaking countries the serialised novel was widely popularised by the weekly family magazine  which reached a circulation of 382000 by 1875 In Russia The Russian Messenger serialised Leo Tolstoys Anna Karenina from 1873 to 1877 and Fyodor Dostoevskys The Brothers Karamazov from 1879 to 1880 In Poland Bolesław Prus wrote several serialised novels: The Outpost (Prus novel)
In addition works in late Qing dynasty China had been serialised The Ninetailed Turtle was serialised from 1906 to 1910 Bizarre Happenings Eyewitnessed over Two Decades was serialised in Xin Xiaoshuo (T: 新小說 S: 新小说 P: Xīn Xiǎoshuō; W: Hsin Hsiaoshuo; "New Fiction") a magazine by Liang Qichao The first half of Officialdom Unmasked appeared in instalments of Shanghai Shijie Fanhua Bao serialised there from April 1903 to June 1905

 Late 20th and early 21st centuries 
With the rise of broadcast—both radio and television series—in the first half of the 20th century printed periodical fiction began a slow decline as newspapers and magazines shifted their focus from entertainment to information and news However some serialisation of novels in periodicals continued with mixed success

The first several books in the Tales of the City series by Armistead Maupin appeared from 1978 as regular instalments in San Francisco newspapers Similar serial novels ran in other city newspapers such as The Serial (1976; Marin County) Tangled Lives (Boston) Bagtime (Chicago) and Federal Triangle (Washington DC) Starting in 1984 Tom Wolfes The Bonfire of the Vanities about contemporary New York City ran in 27 parts in Rolling Stone partially inspired by the model of Dickens The magazine paid $200000 for his work but Wolfe heavily revised the work before publication as a standalone novel Alexander McCall Smith author of The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency series experimented in 2004 with publishing his novel 44 Scotland Street in instalments every weekday in The Scotsman Michael Chabon serialised Gentlemen of the Road in The New York Times Magazine in 2007

The emergence of the World Wide Web prompted some authors to revise a serial format Stephen King experimented with The Green Mile (novel)
Conversely graphic novels became more popular in this period containing stories that were originally published in a serial format for example Alan Moores Watchmen

The rise of fan fiction on the internet also follows a serial fiction style of publication as seen on websites such as FanFictionNet and Archive of Our Own
In addition the prevalence of mobile devices made the serial format even more popular with the likes of JukePop Serials and Serial Box with iOS and Android apps that focus entirely on curating and promoting serialised novels
