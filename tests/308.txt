Fossil water or paleowater is an ancient body of water that has been contained in some undisturbed space typically groundwater in an aquifer for millennia Other types of fossil water can include subglacial lakes such as Antarcticas Lake Vostok and even ancient water on other planets

UNESCO defines fossil groundwater as


Determining the time since water infiltrated usually involves analyzing isotopic signatures Determining "fossil" status—whether or not that particular water has occupied that particular space since the distant past—involves modeling the flow Groundwater recharge
 Renewability 
Large prolific aquifers (notably the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System and the Ogallala Aquifer) containing fossil water are of significant socioeconomic value Fossil water is extracted from these aquifers for many human purposes notably agriculture Industrial sector
 General geology 
Aquifers are typically composed of semiporous rock or unconsolidated material whose pore space has been filled with water In the relatively rare cases of confined aquifers an impermeable geologic layer (eg clay or Caliche
Most fossil groundwater has been estimated to have originally infiltrated within the Holocene and Pleistocene (10000–40000 years ago) Some fossil groundwater is associated with the melting of ice in the time since the Last Glacial Maximum
Fossil water can potentially dissolve and absorb a number of ions from its host rock Salinity in groundwater can be higher than seawater In some cases some form of treatment is required to make these waters suitable for human use Saline fossil aquifers can also store significant quantities of petroleum
 Notable bodies of fossil water 

 Ogallala Aquifer 

The Ogallala or High Plains Aquifer sits under 450000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of 8 states of the United States of America It is one of the largest Fresh water
The aquifer supplies water for the many people who live above it and for widespread agricultural uses In many areas the water table has dropped drastically due to heavy extraction Depletion rates are not stabilizing; in fact they have been increasing in recent decadesFile:ManMadeRiverLibya7Ajpg
 Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System 

The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is located in northeastern Africa under the nations of Sudan Libya Egypt and Chad covering about 2000000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> It is largely composed of many hydraulically interconnected sandstone aquifers Some parts of the system are considered to be confined if somewhat leaky due to impermeable layers such as marine shales The water was deposited between 4000 and 20000 years ago varying by specific locality

The water in the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is of high importance to the people living above it and has been for millennia In modern times as demand increases avoiding rapid depletion and international conflict will depend on careful crossboundary monitoring and planning Libya and Egypt are currently planning development projects to withdraw significant amounts of the aquifers fossil water for use

Other fossil aquifers have been identified throughout Northern Africa as well

 Kalahari Desert aquifers 
The Kalahari Desert is in central southern Africa (Botswana Namibia and South Africa) Geology of the area includes significant karst formations Most of the precipitation in the region evaporates before it can contribute to significant recharge of the aquifers below Whether or not the regions aquifers receive any significant recharge has long been the subject of debate and research In the northern region of the Kalahari a deep aquifer in Cave sandstone was found to have isotopic signatures that suggested it had been confined with little to no leakage for long periods of time
