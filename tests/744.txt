 Limitations 

 Test Selection and Inadequate Assessment 

Despite the availability of numerous guidelines to assist psychologists in conducting EvidenceBased Assessments (EBAs) professionals often fall short in adhering to these guidelines Projective tests for instance are frequently employed in the assessment of child adjustment It has been observed that there is considerable variability among professionals in following professional guidelines leading to instances where evaluators fail to assess general parenting abilities adequately

 Issues in Test Interpretation 

Professionals and authorities often erroneously recommend interpreting variability between and within scales that might not have been rigorously tested For example due to thorough efforts in establishing norms reliability and validity measures certain measures like the Wechsler intelligence scales for both adults and children are considered as some of the most reliable psychological instruments Authorities often advise the consideration of subtest scores However unlike fullscale IQ scores subtest scores frequently have lower levels of internal consistency reliability (psychometrics)
