A bacteriophage () also known informally as a phage () is a virus that infects and replicates within bacteria and archaea. The term was derived from "bacteria" and the Greek language
Bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the biosphere. Bacteriophages are ubiquitous viruses found wherever bacteria exist. It is estimated there are more than 10<sup>31</sup> bacteriophages on the planet more than every other organism on Earth including bacteria combined. Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in the water column of the worlds oceans and the second largest component of biomass after prokaryotes where up to 9x10<sup>8</sup> virus
Phages have been used since the late 20th century as an alternative to antibiotics in the former Soviet Union and Central Europe as well as in France. They are seen as a possible therapy against multi-drug-resistant strains of many bacteria (see phage therapy).

Phages are known to interact with the immune system both indirectly via bacterial expression of phage-encoded proteins and directly by influencing innate immunity and bacterial clearance.

 Classification 
Bacteriophages occur abundantly in the biosphere with different genomes and lifestyles. Phages are classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) according to morphology (biology)

It has been suggested that members of Picobirnaviridae infect bacteria but not mammals.

There are also many unassigned genera of the class Leviviricetes: Chimpavirus Hohglivirus Mahrahvirus Meihzavirus Nicedsevirus Sculuvirus Skrubnovirus Tetipavirus and Winunavirus containing linear ssRNA genomes and the unassigned genus Lilyvirus of the order Caudovirales containing a linear dsDNA genome.

 History 
File:Félix dHérelle.jpg
In 1896 Ernest Hanbury Hankin reported that something in the waters of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India had a marked antibacterial action against cholera and it could pass through a very fine porcelain filter. In 1915 United Kingdom a stage in the Biological life cycle an enzyme produced by the bacteria themselves or
 a virus that grew on and destroyed the bacteria

Tworts research was interrupted by the onset of World War I as well as a shortage of funding and the discoveries of antibiotics.

Independently French-Canadian microbiologist Félix dHérelle working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris announced on 3 September 1917 that he had discovered "an invisible antagonistic microbe of the dysentery bacillus". For dHérelle there was no question as to the nature of his discovery: "In a flash I had understood: what caused my clear spots was in fact an invisible microbe... a virus parasitic on bacteria." DHérelle called the virus a bacteriophage a bacteria-eater (from the Greek  meaning "to devour"). He also recorded a dramatic account of a man suffering from dysentery who was restored to good health by the bacteriophages. It was dHérelle who conducted much research into bacteriophages and introduced the concept of phage therapy. In 1919 in Paris France dHérelle conducted the first clinical application of a bacteriophage with the first reported use in the United States being in 1922.

 Nobel prizes awarded for phage research 
In 1969 Max Delbrück Alfred Hershey and Salvador Luria were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries of the replication of viruses and their genetic structure. Specifically the work of Hershey as contributor to the Hershey–Chase experiment in 1952 provided convincing evidence that DNA not protein was the genetic material of life. Delbrück and Luria carried out the Luria–Delbrück experiment which demonstrated statistically that mutations in bacteria occur randomly and thus follow Natural selection

Phages were discovered to be antibacterial agents and were used in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia (country)* Antibiotics were discovered and marketed widely. They were easier to make store and prescribe.
* Medical trials of phages were carried out but a basic lack of understanding of phages raised questions about the validity of these trials.
* Publication of research in the Soviet Union was mainly in the Russian language
The use of phages has continued since the end of the Cold War in Russia Georgia and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. The first regulated randomized double-blind clinical trial was reported in the Journal of Wound Care in June 2009 which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a bacteriophage cocktail to treat infected venous ulcers of the leg in human patients. The FDA approved the study as a Phase I clinical trial. The studys results demonstrated the safety of therapeutic application of bacteriophages but did not show efficacy. The authors explained that the use of certain chemicals that are part of standard wound care (e.g. lactoferrin or silver) may have interfered with bacteriophage viability. The study concludes that bacteriophage preparations were safe and effective for treatment of chronic ear infections in humans. Additionally there have been numerous animal and other experimental clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of bacteriophages for various diseases such as infected burns and wounds and cystic fibrosis-associated lung infections among others.

Meanwhile bacteriophage researchers have been developing engineered viruses to overcome antimicrobial resistance
Therapeutic efficacy of a phage cocktail was evaluated in a mice model with nasal infection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii. Mice treated with the phage cocktail showed a 2.3-fold higher survival rate compared to those untreated at seven days post-infection. In 2017 a patient with a pancreas compromised by MDR A. baumannii was put on several antibiotics; despite this the patients health continued to deteriorate during a four-month period. Without effective antibiotics the patient was subjected to phage therapy using a phage cocktail containing nine different phages that had been demonstrated to be effective against MDR A. baumannii. Once on this therapy the patients downward clinical trajectory reversed and returned to health.

DHerelle "quickly learned that bacteriophages are found wherever bacteria thrive: in sewers in rivers that catch waste runoff from pipes and in the stools of convalescent patients." This includes rivers traditionally thought to have healing powers including Indias Ganges River.

 Other 
Food industry – Phages have increasingly been used to safen food products and to forestall spoilage bacteria. Since 2006 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have approved several bacteriophage products. LMP-102 (Intralytix) was approved for treating ready-to-eat (RTE) poultry and meat products. In that same year the FDA approved LISTEX (developed and produced by Micreos (company)
Diagnostics – In 2011 the FDA cleared the first bacteriophage-based product for in vitro diagnostic use. The KeyPath MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test uses a cocktail of bacteriophage to detect Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures and determine methicillin resistance or susceptibility. The test returns results in about five hours compared to two to three days for standard microbial identification and susceptibility test methods. It was the first accelerated antibiotic-susceptibility test approved by the FDA.

Counteracting bioweapons and toxins – Government agencies in the West have for several years been looking to Georgia (country)
The sensing of phage-triggered ion cascades
Phage display is a different use of phages involving a library of phages with a variable peptide linked to a surface protein. Each phage genome encodes the variant of the protein displayed on its surface (hence the name) providing a link between the peptide variant and its encoding gene. Variant phages from the library may be selected through their binding affinity to an immobilized molecule (e.g. botulism toxin) to neutralize it. The bound selected phages can be multiplied by reinfecting a susceptible bacterial strain thus allowing them to retrieve the peptides encoded in them for further study.

Antimicrobial drug discovery – Phage proteins often have antimicrobial activity and may serve as leads for peptidomimetics i.e. drugs that mimic peptides. Phage-ligand technology makes use of phage proteins for various applications such as binding of bacteria and bacterial components (e.g. endotoxin) and lysis of bacteria.

Basic research – Bacteriophages are important model organisms for studying principles of evolution and ecology.

Detriments
Dairy industry
Bacteriophages present in the environment can cause cheese to not ferment. In order to avoid this mixed-strain starter cultures and culture rotation regimes can be used. Genetic engineering of culture microbes – especially Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus – have been studied for genetic analysis and modification to improve phage resistance. This has especially focused on plasmid and recombinant DNA
Some research has focused on the potential of bacteriophages as antimicrobial against foodborne pathogens and biofilm formation within the dairy industry. As the spread of antibiotic resistance is a main concern within the dairy industry phages can serve as a promising alternative.

 Replication 
File:Phage injection.pngThe life cycle of bacteriophages tends to be either a lytic cycle or a lysogenic cycle. In addition some phages display pseudolysogenic behaviors.

With lytic phages such as the T4 phage bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. As soon as the cell is destroyed the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. Lytic phages are more suitable for phage therapy. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of the Temperateness (virology)
In contrast the lysogenic cycle does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as temperate phages. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it relatively harmlessly or may even become established as a plasmid. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate perhaps due to depletion of nutrients then the endogenous phages (known as prophages) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce the virus is replicated in all offspring of the cell. An example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the phage lambda of E. coli.

Sometimes prophages may provide benefits to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the bacterial genome in a phenomenon called lysogenic conversion. Examples are the conversion of harmless strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae or Vibrio cholerae by bacteriophages to highly virulent ones that cause diphtheria or cholera respectively. Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these toxin-encoding prophages have been proposed.

 Attachment and penetration 

File:Phage.jpg<!-- Deleted image removed: File:Trialphage.jpgBacterial cells are protected by a cell wall of polysaccharides which are important virulence factors protecting bacterial cells against both immune host defenses and antibiotics. 
Host growth conditions also influence the ability of the phage to attach and invade them. As phage virions do not move independently they must rely on random encounters with the correct receptors when in solution such as blood lymphatic circulation irrigation soil water etc.

Myovirus bacteriophages use a hypodermic syringe-like motion to inject their genetic material into the cell. After contacting the appropriate receptor the tail fibers flex to bring the base plate closer to the surface of the cell. This is known as reversible binding. Once attached completely irreversible binding is initiated and the tail contracts possibly with the help of Adenosine triphosphate
 Synthesis of proteins and nucleic acid 
Within minutes bacterial ribosomes start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages RNA replicase is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial RNA polymerase so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The hosts normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell helper proteins that contribute to the assemblage of new virions or proteins involved in cell lysis. In 1972 Walter Fiers (University of Ghent Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene and in 1976 of the viral genome of bacteriophage MS2. Some DNAssDNA vs. dsDNA
 Virion assembly 
In the case of the T4 phage the construction of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins that act catalytically during phage morphogenesis. The base plates are assembled first with the tails being built upon them afterward. The head capsids constructed separately will spontaneously assemble with the tails.  During assembly of the Escherichia virus T4
 Release of virions 
Phages may be released via cell lysis by extrusion or in a few cases by budding. Lysis by tailed phages is achieved by an enzyme called endolysin which attacks and breaks down the cell wall peptidoglycan. An altogether different phage type the filamentous phage makes the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free and unless defective are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host and instead become long-term residents as prophages.

 Communication 
Research in 2017 revealed that the bacteriophage Φ3T makes a short viral protein that signals other bacteriophages to lie dormant instead of killing the host bacterium. Arbitrium is the name given to this protein by the researchers who discovered it.

 Genome structure 
Given the millions of different phages in the environment phage genomes come in a variety of forms and sizes. RNA phages such as Bacteriophage MS2Some marine roseobacter phages contain deoxyuridine (dU) instead of Thymidine
 Systems biology 
The field of systems biology investigates the complex Biological network
For instance infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the temperate phage PaP3 changed the expression of 38% (2160/5633) of its hosts genes. Many of these effects are probably indirect hence the challenge becomes to identify the direct interactions among bacteria and phage.

Several attempts have been made to map protein–protein interactions among phage and their host. For instance bacteriophage lambda was found to interact with its host Escherichia coli
 Host resistance 
Bacteriophages are a major threat to bacteria and prokaryotes have evolved numerous mechanisms to block infection or to block the replication of bacteriophages within host cells. The CRISPR
 Bacteriophage–host symbiosis 
Temperate phages are bacteriophages that integrate their genetic material into the host as extrachromosomal episomes or as a prophage during a lysogenic cycle. Some temperate phages can confer fitness advantages to their host in numerous ways including giving antibiotic resistance through the transfer or introduction of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) protecting hosts from phagocytosis protecting hosts from secondary infection through superinfection exclusion enhancing host pathogenicity or enhancing bacterial metabolism or growth. Bacteriophage–host symbiosis may benefit bacteria by providing selective advantages while passively replicating the phage genome.

 In the environment 

Metagenomics has allowed the in-water detection of bacteriophages that was not possible previously.

Also bacteriophages have been used in hydrology
Bacteriophages are thought to contribute extensively to horizontal gene transfer in natural environments principally via transduction (genetics)
 In humans 
Although phages do not infect humans there are countless phage particles in the human body given our extensive microbiome. Our phage population has been called the human phageome including the "healthy gut phageome" (HGP) and the "diseased human phageome" (DHP). The active phageome of a healthy human (i.e. actively replicating as opposed to nonreplicating integrated prophage) has been estimated to comprise dozens to thousands of different viruses.
There is evidence that bacteriophages and bacteria interact in the  Gut microbiota
Preliminary studies have indicated that common bacteriophages are found in 62% of healthy individuals on average while their prevalence was reduced by 42% and 54% on average in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohns disease (CD). Abundance of phages may also decline in the elderly.

The most common phages in the human intestine found worldwide are crAssphages. CrAssphages are transmitted from mother to child soon after birth and there is some evidence suggesting that they may be transmitted locally. Each person develops their own unique crAssphage clusters. CrAss-like phages also may be present in primates besides humans.

 Commonly studied bacteriophage 
Among the countless phage only a few have been studied in detail including some historically important phage that were discovered in the early days of microbial genetics. These especially the T-phage helped to discover important principles of gene structure and function.
