Carlos "Panama" Lewis (November 4 1945 – September 19 2020) was an American boxing trainer He was convicted of tampering with the gloves of Luis Resto (boxer)
Early career
Lewis was a disciple of trainer Chickie Ferrara  He was Roberto Duráns cornerman when Duran lost a unanimous decision against Wilfred Benítez in 1982

During the early 1980s he was considered one of the best trainers of his time compared with Emanuel Steward and Lou Duva  The most noted boxer in his stable was lightwelterweight champion Aaron Pryor In 1982 Pryor fought Alexis Argüello Before the fourteenth round a cornerman held up a plastic water bottle but Showtime (TV network)
It was later alleged in an interview with former Lewistrained boxer Luis Resto (boxer)
Resto–Collins controversy

The most notorious incident in Lewiss career took place on June 16 1983 A fighter he was training Luis Resto (boxer)
Resto won in a 10round unanimous decision over a bloody Collins  After the fight Resto came to Collins corner to shake hands with Collins father and trainer Billy Sr  When Billy Sr grabbed Restos hand he discovered Restos gloves were thinner than normal  Screaming that he thought the gloves had no padding Collins Sr demanded that the New York State Boxing Commission impound the gloves  An investigation found that each glove was missing an ounce of padding  There was also a 075inch hole in the palm of each glove  Collins suffered a torn Iris (anatomy)
After an investigation the New York State Boxing Commission determined Lewis had tampered with the gloves  On July 1 1983 it permanently revoked Lewis state boxing license  Since most state boxing commissions honor sanctions imposed by other states this action had the effect of banning Lewis from ever having another official role in an American bout

In October 1986 Lewis and Resto were both put on trial and found guilty of assault criminal possession of a weapon (Restos hands) and conspiracy  Lewis was also found guilty of tampering with a sports contest  Prosecutors charged that since Lewis had deliberately removed the padding from Restos gloves the bout with Collins amounted to an illegal assault  Lewis was sentenced to six years in prison Resto to three years Lewis was released from prison in 1990

Collins died on March 6 1984 when he crashed his car into a culvert near his home in Antioch Tennessee Many think he may have committed suicide because he was unable to continue boxing as a result of the actions of Lewis and Resto<ref>Citation

Years later during the filming of the 2008 documentary Assault in the Ring Resto admitted that he knew Lewis had not only tampered with the gloves but Lewis had also wrapped Restos hands with modern Plaster
Lewis maintained his innocence till his death and many of his defenders allege that someone instead removed the padding from Restos gloves after the bout For instance an official with the New York State Boxing Commission left the gloves in his car after receiving them from the state boxing commission However this is belied by pictures of Collins face after the bout; it was badly swollen and many felt it was improbable a light puncher like Resto could have inflicted such damage on his own

When confronted by Resto and Assault in the Ring director and producer Eric Drath Lewis again denied any wrongdoing and said that it was cornerman Artie Curley who had wrapped Restos hands An agitated Lewis said that if Curley were alive today "none of this would have happened to him"
