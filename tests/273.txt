History of the conflict
Disqualification (1972)

After reaching the status of "top money winner on this years LPGA tour" Blalock was competing in the Bluegrass Invitational in Louisville Kentucky by mid May 1972 After the second round the LPGA executive board called Blalock in to tell her she was disqualified from the tournament contending that she signed an incorrect scorecard and also levying a $500 fine Although Blalocks scorecards had been signed and attested by fellow competitors Tourney director Gene Mcauliff stated that Blalock "did not mark her ball properly on the 17th green and then failed to take a twostroke penalty as required for that infraction"

All five members of the executive committee Linda Craft Sharon Miller Judy Rankin Cynthia Sullivan and Penny Zavichas were themselves active players After Blalocks initial interaction with the committee at the Bluegrass Invitational 27 LPGA players signed an affidavit demanding "that more severe action be taken against Jane Blalock" specifically arguing that probation a fine and disqualification from the Bluegrass tournament were not enough punishment

On May 20 1972 the LPGA executive board suspended Blalock for one year "for actions inconsistent with the code of ethics of the organization" The suspension came shortly after the announcement that Blalock wouldnt be allowed to compete in the Potamkin Cadillac Classic
In defending their reasons for the suspension the board stated in a press release that "the action was taken after Miss Blalock met with the executive committee on three occasions in the last 10 days She admitted actions on the golf course which are contrary to the rules of the game" According to Sports Illustrated the board also claimed that Blalock had "been under suspicion for over a year that there had been repeated violations that witnesses in the gallery at Louisville had observed her replacing the ball to the side of her marker on the green and that Janie tearfully admitted to her guilt Miss Blalock was denying everything" LPGA executive director Bud Erickson also stated that he had requested Blalock to feign a back injury in an effort to avoid bad publicity but she refused

Initial antitrust lawsuit (1972)
On June 1 1972 Blalock filed a $5 million United States antitrust law
Around June 19 Blalock met with the LGPA in US District Court in Atlanta over the lawsuit Later that month US District Court Judge Charles Allen Moye Jr
Colleagues initial reactions (1972)
News of the suspension and alleged rules violation drew significant press coverage as well as mixed reactions from Blalocks colleagues Though he said he had never seen her move a ball against the rules himself her former instructor Bob Toski stated that "She has a compulsion to win I think she needs psychiatric help" and "the other players tell me this has been going on for a while" In contrast Blalocks caddie from the Suzuki tournament contacted her with an offer to testify in her support Mens professional golfer Dave Hill (golfer)

Probation of Sandra Palmer (1972)

Rulings and settlements (1973â€“75)

After filing the original antitrust suit Blalock amended the suit to include only damages from not being able to compete in the Lady Carling Tournament in 1972 for $4500
In June 1973 Judge Charles Moye Jr ruled that "LGPA players cannot police their own members" The ruling declared that Blalocks suspension "was illfounded" with all remaining litigation to be focused on damages In September 1973 The Telegraph (Nashua)
In August 1974 a court awarded Blalock the full $4500 she had asked for in damages with the LPGA again announcing plans to appeal Afterwards in March 1975 Judge Charles Moye again ruled in Blalocks favor awarding her $13500 in damages and ordering the LPGA to pay her legal fees of $95303 The LPGA again announced it would appeal the ruling in its entirety Ray Volpe was appointed the first LPGA Commissioner on July 8 1975 and a month later the LPGA announced it had dropped its appeal and settled "all claims and counter claims growing from a dispute between it and golfer Jane Blalock"

Aftermath
Blalock refused to condemn her critics including her former mentor Bob Toski after her lawsuit was settled She said to a reporter in 1978 "I should not judge others as they have judged me Life is too short and there is too much sadness So I cant clutter my mind with all that other stuff It makes it hard to concentrate" Toski returned in April 1986 and played several more years on the Tour

Blalock continued playing on the LPGA Tour through 1987 When she was through playing Blalock had 27 Tour wins to her credit She was the first female golfer to earn over $100000 in four consecutive years and the seventh overall to reach the one million dollar mark in career earnings Between 1969 and 1980 Blalock made the cut in 299 consecutive tournaments an alltime LPGA Tour record

In 1976 Blalock testified for the LPGA Tour in a suit against a sponsor trying to start a Womens Masters Tournament Blalock wrote a column  for the Miami Herald in 1981 complaining about the associations overuse of sex appeal in promoting the tour

With 27 LPGA Tour wins Blalock almost qualified for the World Golf Hall of Fame under the standards in use as of 2011 However she never won a major championship in her career nor was she ever LPGA Player of the Year or winner of the LPGA Vare Trophy Judy Rankin and Donna Caponi have fewer career wins than Blalock but have been selected by the Veterans Committee Blalock said in 2001 "Its almost a relief that I dont qualify What if every year my name came up and every year I didnt make it? Id be thinking is what happened the reason?"

In July 2014 she was voted into the Legends Tour
