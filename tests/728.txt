Eurocode 7 is intended to:
be used in conjunction with EN 1990 which establishes the principles and requirements for safety and serviceability describes the basis of design and verification and gives guidelines for related aspects of structural reliability
be applied to the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works and it is concerned with the requirements for strength stability serviceability and durability of structures

Eurocode 7 is composed of the following parts

Part 1: General rules
EN 19971 is intended to be used as a general basis for the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works

Contents
 General
 Basis of design
 Geotechnical data
 Supervision of construction monitoring and maintenance
 Fill dewatering ground improvement and reinforcement
 Spread foundations
 Deep foundation (pile foundations)
 Anchorages
 Retaining structures
 Hydraulic failure
 Overall stability
 wikt:embankment
EN 19971 is accompanied by Annexes A to J which provide:
Annex A Recommended partial safety factor values; different values of the partial factors may be set by the National annex
Annexes B to J Supplementary informative guidance such as internationally applied calculation methods

Part 2: Ground investigation and testing
EN 19972 is intended to be used in conjunction with EN 19971 and provides rules supplementary to EN 19971 related to planning and reporting of ground investigations general requirements for a range of commonly used laboratory and field tests interpretation and evaluation of test results and derivation of values of geotechnical parameters and coefficients

Part 3: Design assisted by field testing
There is no longer a Part 3 It was amalgamated into EN 19972
