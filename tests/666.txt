Equinalysis is a computer software program designed to capture and analyse equine animal locomotion
Operation

For the analysis polystyrene markers are placed at specific points on the horses limbs mainly over the joints Then the horse is walked and trotted inhand and filmed with a video camera from all angles on a hard flat surface The information is then collated and downloaded on to a CD or DVD which is analyzed on a computer by an accredited individual The specialist software program records the movement of the markers and produces data that can be used to quantify stride length body symmetry joint flexion and extension and soundness The resulting baseline of facts  which is presented in a hardcopy portfolio of information for future reference  then provides the horse owner with a valuable baseline measurement of movement and soundness

 Reliability 
A 2011 study published in the https://wwwsciencedirectcom/science/article/abs/pii/S0737080611003790?via%3Dihub Journal of Equine Veterinary Science found the system did not produce repeatable data from day to day and was therefore not sufficiently reliable for use in clinical evaluations of equine lameness
