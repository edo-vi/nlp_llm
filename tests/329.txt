Caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) is a Virus
Two syndromes of CAE occur Adult goats develop a chronic progressive arthritis whereas young goats develop a neurological syndrome with signs of paresis or paralysis Less commonly mastitisOther animals
Infection is lifelong and it may be years before signs of the disease occur The reason for the long (and variable) period of dormancy of the virus is not known

In goats which develop arthritis the joints become inflamed and swollen and the goats will slowly lose condition  In some cases the goat will not be able to stand 

In goats which develop the neurological form of the disease the onset of signs is gradual over several weeks The hind legs are most often affected The goat will be uncoordinated and unable to place its feet properly so that it "knuckles" that is it stands with the front of its fetlock on the ground rather than its hoof The goat has increased difficulty standing and eventually is unable to stand

The disease is spread to goat kids when they drink colostrum or milk from infected goats 

There is no known cure To prevent spread of the disease infected animals are separated from noninfected goats or culled
