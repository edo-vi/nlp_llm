History
File:ScopitonequandoquandojpgThe first Scopitones were made in France by a company called Cameca on Blvd Saint Denis in Courbevoie among them Serge Gainsbourgs "Le poinçonneur des Lilas" (filmed in 1958 in the Porte des Lilas (Paris Métro)
Scopitones spread to West Germany where the Kessler Twins
Several wellknown acts of the 1960s appear in Scopitone films ranging from the earlier part of the decade The Exciters ("Tell Him (Bert Berns song)
The mediums focus on adult audiences and the resulting avoidance of or inability to lure the superstar American or British Invasion acts of the era was a factor in its demise; for example when The Beatles decided to enter the music video business in 1965 they opted to bypass the Scopitone and distribute their promotional films via television Other factors included the declining taste and poor quality of the productions (particularly those made in the United States) changing taste toward psychedelic rock and a late 1960s sting that revealed that the Scopitone business had deep ties to the Sicilian Mafia

Even though the popularity of the Scopitone had faded away by the end of the 1960sthe same concept was still in limited use throughout the 1970s by acts such as the The Carpenters
