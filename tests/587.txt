Technology doping is the practice of gaining a competitive advantage using sports equipment The World AntiDoping Agency (WADA) considers prohibiting technologies if they are "performanceenhancing" or "being against the spirit of the sport" In 2006 WADA initiated a consultation on technology doping which is now officially recognised as a threat whilst the decision to allow or ban a new technology specifically relating to sports equipment is the responsibility of each sport’s own governing body

 Gray area 
Since most sports require equipment of some sort it can be tricky to determine what is technology doping and what is not  The Sports governing bodyA report released immediately before the 2012 Summer Olympics quotes an extensive public survey that shows that people fear that sports engineering could: overshadow the triumph of human spirit and effort make certain sports easier create unfairness so the "best athletes" might not win and ensure that rich athletes and countries have an advantage over the poor ones

 Examples 

 LZR Racer swimsuit 

The LZR Racer is a swimsuit by Speedo that was launched in 2008  It is made with a material that was designed to mimic shark skin  The suit allows for better oxygen flow to the muscles holds the body in a more hydrodynamic position and traps air which adds buoyancy

At the 2008 Beijing Olympics this suit was worn by many swimmers  In fact some swimmers wore two or more of these suits at once to increase buoyancy  In total 23 out of the 25 swimming world records broken at the Beijing Olympics were broken by swimmers wearing this suit In subsequent competitions many world records were broken by swimmers wearing the LZR suit

There was widespread discussion over whether these suits were so technologically advanced that using them was technology doping In 2009 FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) decided to ban all bodylength swimsuits  Mens suits could only maximally cover from the waist to the knee  Womens suits could only cover from shoulder to knee  They also stipulated that the fabric used to make the suits must be a "textile" and the suit could not have fastening devices such as zippers  These new rules took effect in January 2010

 Vaporfly shoes 


The Nike Vaporfly running shoe was launched in 2017 Its sole has Pebax foam and a fulllength carbon fiber plate As with the LZR case it was debated whether they were a form of technology doping

 Ionized shirts 

A New Zealand firm has created “IonX shirts” which are made of a material that claims to contain a negatively charged electromagnetic field  It further claims that the shirt helps increase blood flow which in turn helps deliver more oxygen to the muscles and remove lactic acid from the muscles more quickly  The World AntiDoping Agency has ruled that since there is no scientific publication that confirms the material actually changes the body’s ion charges or enhances performance and also the material does not contain prohibited substances this technology is not banned as of now

 Interactive materials 

Researchers at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation an Australian science agency created a garment that can monitor movement and give feedback  For example a basketball player can wear the material in the form of a sleeve  Then sensors in the material send information to a computer when the player takes shots and responds with audible tones giving the athlete realtime feedback on their movements  Athletes can learn patterns of tones that indicate successful or unsuccessful movements and use these to make improvements  The material helps correct the athlete’s movement and helps the athlete gain muscle memory so they can continue to perform well once the material is taken away

 Mechanical doping 


In cycle sport
 Artificial limbs 

Amputees can compete in the Paralympic Games using artificial limbs There has been significant Oscar PistoriusDispute over prostheses
 Telemetry hacking 

Prior to the Womens World Gliding Championship at Lake Keepit 2020 the competition organisers mandated the use of a real time tracking system to make the sport more appealing to the general public To maintain the challenge of the race the positions of each competitor was delayed by 15 minutes After a few days of competing  the extreme accuracy with which the Australian pilots predicted the movements of their opponents lead to suspicions and on the penultimate day of the contest the Australian team captain Terry Cubley (EO of the Gliding Federation of Australia
 Recumbent bicycle 

Recumbent bicycles broke cycling world records in the early 1930s before they were banned by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 1934

 Standardized equipment 

Many sports set standards for equipment to prevent unfair advantages between competitors  This often involves the types of materials the equipment is made from or dimensions/sizes For example tennis racquets must not exceed the maximum length and width limits Association football balls must not exceed weight limits Golf clubs must fit shape regulations

Onedesign racing is a type of vehicle racing in which all competitors pilot identical vehicles In theory the race depends only on the difference in the skill of the crew rather than the quality of the vehicle
