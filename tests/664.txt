Sexuality in music videos has been evident since the 1980s

1980s
On August 1 1981 MTV the first 24hour music video channel began broadcasting Directed towards adolescents it promoted societal trends through video content and advertisements The material displayed helped the audience identify appropriate male and female roles behaviors and careers In contrast common male clichés were: dominant professional occupations and aggressive The Rolling Stones AC/DC Michael Jackson and Guns N Roses were  significant musicians featured on MTV Music Television had a commanding influence on its audience and heavily affected the ways adolescents viewed their role in society

Music videos released in the 1980s typically depicted women as alluring objects Aligning with typical stereotypes women were portrayed as attractive yet submissive Although womens talents may be acknowledged their skill never surpassed the males; this concept is evident in AC/DCs video for "Sink the Pink" In the video one of the main characters is a selfassured woman who is a skilled pool player She uses her talent and sexuality as an attentiongetter but is not shown as more talented than the male characters

In a 1987 study thirty hours of MTV content was analyzed The results suggested: 57% of music videos displayed women being objectified 17% showed womens talents being accounted for yet her sexual role was highlighted 14% did not align with typical stereotypes and 12% acknowledged womens independence In addition to these results touching was displayed in over 50% of music videos and women were often seen in seductive clothing

1990s
Music remained an essential part of the cultural evolution of the 1990s The music scene transitioned into a darker and more provocative sound with the rise of the genres of alternative rock
In early 1990 MTV created a program standards department which aimed to reject music videos featuring extremely graphic and explicit content It sought to prohibit any signs of female nudity and violence directed toward female figures For example MTV rejected Madonna (entertainer)
Other studies analyzed 123 music videos from varying genres that aired in the summer of 1995 447% of the videos failed to feature a female in a central role while 317% of the videos portrayed women as conventional meaning they served either as objects or sensory props to romantic male desire However the overtly sexual nature of women in these videos was not the only thing analyzed Gender displays in the form of nonverbal sexual cues were also considered proving women could also be depicted as more subliminally sexual than men For example in the videos only 124% of men touched their hair compared to 3835% of females Additionally only 2680% of males danced suggestively in their videos compared to 74% of females The study examines the distinction between the prominence and depiction of male and female gender portrayals within the music videos of the 1990s

2000s

Music remained integral to cultural life in the 2000s even though not many new genres were created during this time other than a few indierelated and electronic genres Teen Pop had a heavy influence over the 90s and into the first part of the decade Artists like Britney Spears Christina Aguilera NSYNC and Backstreet Boys were extremely popular in the early 2000s By the mid2000s Contemporary R&B had become the most popular genre with artists Like Usher (musician)
A 2008 study by Jacob Turner hypothesized that African American genres of music—hiphop rhythm and blues—would feature the most sexual content in their music videos while white genres—Country and Rock—would feature less The study found that 73% of all music videos had some sort of sexual content The study also found that 9009% of mixed HipHop and R&B music videos contained sexual content followed by HipHop with 797% and R&B with 769% The genres that contained the least amount of sexual content on their music videos were Rock with 40% and Country with 37% The study also looked into how African American and white wallpaper characters were dressed in music videos It found African American wallpaper characters were three times more likely to dress provocatively than white wallpaper characters The study also found that while African Americans were not underrepresented in music videos it proposes this is because videos featuring African Americans contained significantly more sexual content than videos that featured whites
In 2004 many family groups and politicians lobbied unsuccessfully to ban Eric Prydzs "Call on Me (Eric Prydz song)
In 2005 the music video of "These Boots Are Made for Walkin" which featured Jessica Simpson in character as Daisy Duke was controversial for featuring Simpson in "revealing" outfits and washing the General Lee (car)
Sexuality in music videos can be perceived as something positive or negative depending on the viewer It has been growing and impacting the world In 2008 sexual songs were on the top of the Billboard charts Some sexual music videos have brought a varying degree of discomfort to people leading to them being banned For example Madonnas music video for "What It Feels Like for a Girl" was banned due to sexualizing and portraying girls as violent and nontraditional

Role of social media platforms
In the 2000s social media platforms such as Facebook and MySpace grew in popularity allowing users to share music videos quickly with one another This had an impact on the direction of sexuality in music videos Due to the increased accessibility of music videos online many of which featured some sexually suggestive content this led to the increased perception of normality with respect to sexual themes in music videos 

In particular YouTube was a major contributor to this trend The platform launched in early 2005 grew rapidly—with its videos amassing one billion daily videos by October 2009  and became the largest video sharing site on the internet Although YouTubes success in the 2000s was relatively limited compared to its explosive growth in the 2010s it was nevertheless one of the most popular sites on the internet Naturally it became a hub for music videos as many content creators and fans flocked to the site to post content The easy accessibility of various music videos some charged with sexual themes began to increase the perception of its normality

2010s

Into the 2010s artists continued to garner headlines for provocative content in their music videos For example Rihanna
Recent research has looked into the effects music videos that sexually objectify women have on womens body image perceptions A study of college students found that young women with low selfesteem were more likely to view their body in a negative light after exposure to a sexuallyobjectifying music video The same study found exposure to sexually objectifying music videos lessened the extremes of young womens concepts of an ideal body weight A 2017 study found a relationship between sexual content in dance music videos and negative attitudes toward sex and sexuality among young adults in the United States and Australia

Some scholars have noted that sexualized content in music videos rarely depicts nonheterosexuality Frederik Dhaenens has pointed out that when music videos feature gay content it often involves a "heteronormative shaping of gay and lesbian identities" citing Macklemore and Ryan Lewis "Same Love" as an example Carly Rae Jepsens music video "Call Me Maybe" demonstrates the heteronormativity in music videos Its scenes portray stereotypical heterosexual figures who reiterate heterosexuality The music video focuses around heterosexuality by using homosexuality to bring attention to the video Music videos like Disclosure (band)
Expansion of social media
YouTube continued to grow in the 2010s after a successful halfdecade since its launch in the 2000s Sexual themes were explored in videos that grew to enormous popularity on YouTube Meghan Trainors 2014 single "All About That Bass" is one example of this trend although a milder one as the sexual themes were very subtle Nevertheless the video amassed over 23 billion views on YouTube as of November 2019 Also in the 2010s came the rise of music Streaming media
Depictions of race
Studies have shown music videos featuring African American characters tend to feature significantly more depictions of sexual acts than videos featuring white characters For example African American women are more likely to be depicted as engaging in sexual behaviors and wearing provocative clothing A study in the American Journal of Health Education attributed music videos "frank sexual messages objectification and overtly sexual images" to apathy toward these behaviors in African American girls The journal considered this dangerous in light of the heightened HIV risk for African Americans Implications include the idea that Black women may internalize video messages about beauty and sexuality and that Black men and White individuals may form inaccurate and harmful ideas of Black femininity because of music video images <sup>2</sup>

Sexuality has been thoroughly addressed in terms of how it is used in music videos however race in relation to sexuality in music videos has not been covered effectively Race and music have been intertwined for hundreds of years with certain races relating to specific types of music more closely For example younger African Americans tend to listen to hip hop while older whites listen to county and classical music While certain races can relate more to certain music genres modern times have led to an increase in all races listening to all types of music

Although there has been an increase in races listening to all types of music the content in music videos has not changed much Hip hop videos still tend to feature predominantly African Americans with their focus upon a generalized harsh lifestyle that only a portion of the African American population truly faces In addition country songs still tend to focus on a white male lead while their audience has expanded to include many different races over time Youth culture has driven the population to become more accepting towards all types of music genres and videos This has allowed for the roles of certain races and genders within videos to change as well

Modern technology social media and prominent figures in music are increasing the reach of music globally including South Korea and India Their growing influence in the music industry has allowed for many racial stereotypes such as the Indian taxi driver however stereotypes within the US still dominate how people from across the world are portrayed in music videos As an increasing number of American artists have begun to collaborate with foreign artists such as BTS racial stereotyping is becoming less of a factor in how different races are portrayed in music videos

Asian artists like BoA have been accused of presenting Western stereotypes of Asian female sexuality in their music videos in an attempt to gain popularity in the United States Japans Koda Kumi and AKB48 also present sexuality in their music videos Male Kpop star Rain (entertainer)
In the article "Sex and the Spectacles of Music Videos: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos" Jacob Turner studies the sexual behavior portrayed in music videos by two races His study argued that African American women were more likely to portray sexual content than white women in music videos that were televised in the United States This included both the use of provocative clothing and sexual acts in the videos which ultimately showed how gender roles and race play a part in the amount of sexual content in music videos In Erika VanDykes article "Race Body and sexuality in music videos" she argues that men appear more often in music videos than women Men are usually portrayed as "powerful" and "aggressive" characters Consequently women occupy female stereotypical roles in these music videos and are usually seen as passive and are objectified in this manner
