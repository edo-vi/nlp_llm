John D Boswell
Composer John Boswell had been experimenting with sampling and remixing for some time before creating his first YouTube videos Boswell had worked with AutoTune in the past and thought people might be interested in hearing American astronomer Carl Sagan sing He first saw Cosmos in 2004 and soon after bought the set of DVDs Boswell looked through these episodes for "profound quotes" that lacked music in the background  Once he found these quotes Boswell AutoTuned Sagans voice and picked from the best ones  After completing what became "A Glorious Dawn" Boswell posted the video on YouTube in September 2009 and to his surprise the video went viral within a week  To date the video has received nearly ten million views and is ranked as one of the top rated videos of all time in the music category

Born in Idaho John Boswell attended Gonzaga Preparatory School Soon after Boswell started Colorpulse an electronica music project and began to focus on production He released an album in 2010 titled Escaping the Tangle which included some of these productions Boswell lives in Seattle  His music project Symphony of Science "aims to spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes" and to "deliver scientific knowledge and philosophy in musical form" After his first few videos Boswell began seeking permission to use the clips he uses in his project In addition to Symphony of Science Boswell is also working on a project called Remixes for the Soul as well as scientificbased films most notably Timelapse of the Future under the moniker Melodysheep

Reviews
Musician Carrie Brownstein found the idea behind Symphony of Science "quite beautiful and amazing in both its sincerity and aims" She also enjoyed the "hiphop stylings" of the camera angle on Bill Nye while he is moving his hands around and expressing himself on "We Are All Connected" Writer Nick Sagan son of Carl Sagan was impressed with "A Glorious Dawn" giving it a favorable review and stamp of approval Sagan writes "John Boswell over at Colorpulse Music is a mad genius sampling both Cosmos and Stephen Hawkings Universe series into three minutes and thirtyfour seconds of pure concentrated awesomeness Love it love it love it Dad would have loved it too"

Columnist Franklin Harris argues that Boswells videos show that science can arouse the minds of artists just as much as religion and mythology have in the past Harris calls the videos "art for the Information Age inspired by science"

New Music Transmission a podcast who featured Symphony of Science in 2009 gave "A Glorious Dawn" positive reviews and called Symphony of Science as "A thinking mans Pogo (electronic musician)
Christopher Jion of Dirgefunk Records has praised Symphony of Science saying <blockquote>"When I first heard John Boswells "A Glorious Dawn" it brought tears to my eyes it was lifechanging The original idea was to release a compilation of space and sciencethemed tracks from a handful of artists I like (of course including some Symphony Of Science tracks) But as John kept releasing new Symphony Of Science material it became very obvious that it deserved its own album and as its an ongoing project perhaps there will be more volumes to follow This CD is a gift from me to anyone listening who has a passion for music and science It was paid for out of my own pocket with nothing expected in return Its free to anyone wholl appreciate its ideas and messages Dirgefunk Records does not exist for profit Its sole existence is to release material for the enjoyment of myself and likeminded persons So enjoy (April 2012)"</blockquote>Jion released a limited edition music CD compilation in 2012 featuring 15 Symphony of Science tracks listed below:
