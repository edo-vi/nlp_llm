Equine chorionic gonadotropin (acronym given as eCG but not to be confused with ECG) is a gonadotropin
Pregnant mares secrete the hormone from their endometrial cups between 40 and 130 days into their gestation and once collected it has been used to artificially induce estrus in female sheep goats cattle and swine Despite being less pure than pituitary extracts from sheep goats or swine PMSG tends to be used because of its longer circulatory halflife In equids PMSG has only LH like activity but in other species it has activity like both folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)

Equine CG like all glycoprotein hormones is composed of two dissimilar subunits named alpha and beta The alpha subunit is common to all glycoprotein hormones (LH FSH TSH CG) The beta subunits are hormonespecific and are responsible for receptor binding specificity although CG binds to the same Luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor as LH In the equidae
Criticism
The Swissbased Animal Welfare Foundation has criticized how eCG is obtained from horse blood collected by inhumane practices in Uruguayan Argentinian and Icelandic horse farms as documented in undercover videos shot there <ref>

A documentary was released in 2023 regarding the hormone
