The New Orleans Saints bounty scandal colloquially known as "Bountygate" was an improper program in which the New Orleans Saints were found by the National Football League (NFL) to have paid out bonuses or "bounty (reward)
League commissioner Roger Goodell responded with some of the most severe sanctions in the leagues 92year history and among the most severe punishments for ingame misconduct in North American professional sports history Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams was suspended indefinitely though this would be overturned the following year Head coach Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 NFL season
Background
File:Gregg Williams at Tulane Commencement 2010jpgThe NFL has long frowned upon bounties or "noncontract bonuses" as it officially calls them;  but an underground culture of bounties is alleged to exist with teams it is claimed  turning a blind eye to the practice   According to these players such bounty programs were usually informal and often between players only more with intent at lockerroom braggadocio than systemic malice  What would draw attention to the Saints bounty program was the alleged practice of methodically organizing such a concept at the coaches level with the primary intent to systematically and routinely injure opposing star players

Favres agent Bus Cook later said that he also felt the Saints were deliberately trying to knock Favre out of the game and claimed that several hits on Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner in the divisional round a week earlier crossed the line as well It initially appeared that Cooks argument was strengthened by the fact that Warner was knocked out of that game with a chest injury (although he later returned) and retired two weeks later However Warner later said that the hit which knocked him out was legal and had nothing to do with his decision to retire

Investigation
File:Roger Goodell in 2012jpgIn the 2010 offseason an anonymous player told NFL officials that the Saints had targeted Favre and Warner as part of a bounty program administered by Williams; the NFLs security department found the allegations credible enough to open an investigation However the players and team officials interviewed all denied that any bounty program existed and the player who made the initial report subsequently recanted his allegations

The NFL began investigating the Saints in 2010 in response to allegations of deliberate attempts to injure players during the 2009–10 NFL playoffs
Whistleblower
In 2012 ESPN reported that former New Orleans Saints defensive assistant Mike Cerullo contacted the NFL regarding a bounty program after the 2009 postseason Cerullo was released after the 2009 postseason for poor performance and lying about personal leave according to the New Orleans Saints  Cerullo testified that he kept track of payments and pledges made Cerullo also states in the article "I was angry for being let go from the Saints" In the summer of 2017 the NFL hired Mike Cerullo as Director of Football Administration

Findings revealed
multiple image
Late in the 2011 season the NFL received what it called "significant and credible new information" that suggested there was indeed a "bounty" program in place The investigation continued during the 2011–12 NFL playoffs
On March 2 2012 ESPNs Adam Schefter reported that the NFL had indeed found evidence of a bounty program Later that day the NFL announced it had obtained irrefutable proof of a bounty pool dating back to the 2009 season based on a review of 18000 documents It determined that Williams had initiated the fund soon after he arrived in New Orleans in 2009 in hopes of making the defense more aggressive Between 22 and 27 Saints defensive players were involved The players and Williams contributed their own cash to the pot and received cash payments based on their performance in the previous weeks game For instance a special teams
The NFL sent a confidential and detailed memo to all 32 teams detailing its findings It revealed that the Saints had not only targeted Warner and Favre during the 2009 playoffs but had also targeted Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton during the 2011 regular season According to that memo Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma offered $10000 cash to any teammate who knocked Favre out of the NFC Championship Game

After later investigations in the 2012 offseason the NFL also found evidence that the Saints put bounties on several Seattle Seahawks players during their Beast Quake
The league found that Payton not only knew about the scheme but tried to cover it up during both league investigations During the 2010 investigation Payton told Williams and Vitt to "make sure our ducks are in a row" when the league interviewed them Before the start of the 2011 season Payton received an email from Ornstein detailing the broader lines of the scheme In that same email Ornstein offered $5000 to anyone who knocked Rodgers out of the 2011 season opener Payton initially denied knowing that this email existed but subsequently admitted that in fact he had read it

When Benson was informed of the leagues findings he called in Payton and Loomis and ordered the program shut down immediately However they did not do so Loomis had been interviewed during the 2010 investigation as well and had stated that he knew of no such scheme and would stop it immediately if it was taking place The league also found that Vitt whom Payton had assigned to monitor Williams (the two reportedly didnt get along very well) also knew about the broader lines of the scheme and even witnessed Williams handing out payments to players However Vitt failed to tell anyone about it

The NFL found that Payton and Loomis misfeasance amounted to "conduct detrimental" to the league The NFL found no club money had been used to fund the bounty pool and praised Benson for doing what he could to shut down the slush fund Nonetheless it found the Saints organization as a whole guilty of conduct detrimental to the league as well due to Williams and the players maintenance of the bounty pool as well as Loomis and Paytons failure to act "in a responsible manner" to stop it

Several Chicago Bears players and fans believe that the Bears were targets of this program during the second game of the 2011 season a 30–13 loss to the Saints Quarterback Jay Cutler was sacked six times and nearly lost his voice when a Saints player kicked him in the throat Later in the game offensive tackle Frank Omiyale yanked a Saints defender off Cutler when he saw what he later called "some dirty stuff" Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman reported that the Saints tendency toward illegal hits was common knowledge among the Tampa Bay coaching staff Preparations for Saints games included warnings to offensive players to keep their knees protected especially on plays near the sidelines

In June 2012 the league revealed that it possessed a ledger detailing the weekly earnings of the players which are earned for cartoffs ($1000) and "whacks" ($400) and deducted for "mental errors"

However on July 26 2012 Vilma and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal "Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying and categorically denied there was a bounty" Vilma said in a text message to ESPNs Ed Werder "Seven people testified 2 sworn affidavits all saying the same thing I ask that you and ESPN report the facts No more bias or bs or hearsay I gave you facts that you can report if so choose" Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said "Clearly the judge by her questions indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly The NFLs retort is that with all due deference you dont get to second guess (Goodell) Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues"

Other allegations against Williams
Shortly after the Saints bounty system came to light four former Washington Redskins players as well as a coach told The Washington Post that Williams operated a similar system while he was the Redskins defensive coordinator from 2004 to 2007 The players said that Williams paid his crew thousands of dollars for aggressive play with the biggest payouts—as much as $8000—coming for "kill shots" that knocked opposing players out of games Chicago Tribune NFL analyst Matt Bowen (American football)
Several former Bills players subsequently told The Buffalo News of a similar system during Williams tenure as Bills head coach from 2001 to 2003 However they didnt agree on whether there were rewards for intentionally injuring players Coy Wire a safety during Williams tenure said that Williams gave bonuses for hits that left opponents seriously injured and two other players said that bonuses were also awarded for "knockouts" However linebacker Eddie Robinson (linebacker)
Former NFL coach Tony Dungy later told Profootballtalkcom he was certain that Williams operated a similar bounty system while he was defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000 He also believes that Williams put a bounty on Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning during Super Bowl XLIV and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans The revelation of the bounty system also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts in which Manning was knocked down by a highlow hit from the Redskins Phillip Daniels and Andre Carter and appeared to lose some feeling in his neck While Dungy did not speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the Denver Broncos afterward

Aftermath
Williams who left after the season to become defensive coordinator of the St Louis Rams was summoned to NFL headquarters after the investigation concluded in midFebruary He initially denied any involvement but recanted and admitted everything in a meeting with Goodell After the story broke Williams issued a statement calling his involvement "a terrible mistake" Williams said that he knew all along the slush fund broke the rules and that "I should have stopped it" rather than get further involved Goodell said in a statement that he found it "particularly disturbing" that the Saints were deliberately trying to injure other players He said that players and coaches involved in the scheme could face fines or suspensions and the Saints could be docked picks in the 2012 NFL Draft and future drafts

Benson issued a statement on the Saints Website saying "I have been made aware of the NFL’s findings relative to the “Bounty Rule” and how it relates to our club I have offered and the NFL has received our full cooperation in their investigation While the findings may be troubling we look forward to putting this behind us and winning more championships in the future for our fans"

On March 6 Payton and Loomis issued a statement taking "full responsibility" for not stopping the alleged "bounty" program Payton and Loomis also apologized to Benson and the Saints fans and promised that such behavior would never happen again Three days later Drew Brees the starting quarterback for the Saints issued a statement denying any knowledge of or involvement in the program On March 12 WWLTV in New Orleans reported that Payton and Benson met with Goodell in New York for much of the morning to reiterate that the Saints would continue to cooperate fully with the NFLs investigation On March 22 US Senator Dick Durbin
On April 5 documentary filmmaker Sean Pamphilon released audio of a meeting Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers In a profanitylaced speech Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players He ordered his men to try to knock out running back Kendall Hunter even if it meant hitting him out of bounds He specifically directed them to try to Anterior cruciate ligament injury
Sanctions
File:Sean Payton 07feb10jpgCoaches and front office staff
On March 21 2012 the NFL issued sanctions to Saints coaches and frontoffice personnel for their roles in the scandal
 Williams was suspended indefinitely and was banned from applying for reinstatement until the end of the 2012 season at the earliest
 Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season effective April 1
 Loomis was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season
 Vitt who had been tabbed as a possible candidate to serve as interim coach in Paytons absence was suspended for the first six games of the 2012 season (This did not automatically disqualify Vitt from serving as interim head coach per se as his suspension was not effective until the regular season; the suspension terms allowed him to coach the team through training camp and the preseason then return during Week 7 The Saints announced they would implement this scenario for 2012)

The Saints were also fined $500000—the maximum fine permitted under the league constitution and had to forfeit their secondround draft picks in 2012 and 2013 (their firstround pick in 2012 had already been traded to the New England Patriots and therefore could not be forfeited; after the penalty; the Saints first pick in the 2012 NFL Draft is a thirdrounder)

In a statement Goodell said that the NFL would not tolerate "conduct or a culture" that put player safety at risk He also said that the fact that the scheme went on for three years demanded that "a strong and lasting message must be sent that such conduct is totally unacceptable and has no place in the game" He reiterated this in an interview later that day with ESPNs Schefter saying that the fact those involved "continued to mislead" the league about it was a significant factor in the sanctions "You have to be accountable and responsible in the NFL" Goodell said Goodell also implied that Payton would have faced significant punishment in any event since his contractual obligation to supervise his assistants meant that he at least should have known about the scheme He also said that there would be zero tolerance for payments for ingame performance in the future saying that payments for good play eventually escalate to bounties for deliberately injuring players Later Schefter said on ESPNs SportsCenter that league officials felt Payton was at least as guilty as Williams despite initial focus on Williams role as the mastermind in the scheme

On March 30 Payton Vitt and Loomis appealed their suspensions and the Saints also appealed the fine and loss of draft picks Payton Vitt and Loomis met with Goodell on April 5 After that meeting Vitts lawyer David Cornwell said that Payton and Loomis met with Williams before the divisional playoff game and ordered him to shut down the bounty program immediately Cornwell contended that Williams was a "rogue coach" and the recently released audio of his meeting with the defense only proved it

Goodell denied the appeals on April 9 meaning that Paytons suspension began as of April 16 However depending on the Saints cooperation and that of the individuals involved Goodell could restore the Saints secondround pick in 2013 (though the Saints would still lose a lowerround pick) as well as reduce the fine on the Saints and restore Payton Vitt and Loomis lost pay However all appeals were denied

Players
File:Jonathan Vilma Tulane Commencement 2010jpgThe NFLPA requested that the league should hold off on any punishments for the players until it conducts its own investigation Goodell told Schefter however that he would hand down punishments to the players involved very soon once he gets feedback from the NFLPA

Hours after the sanctions were announced Kluwe went on KSTP (AM)
On May 2 2012 the NFL suspended four thencurrent or former Saints players for their involvement in the bounty scandal:
 Vilma was suspended for the entire 2012 NFL season
 Former Saints defensive tackle Anthony Hargrove was suspended for eight games
 Saints defensive end Will Smith (defensive end) Former Saints linebacker Scott Fujita (then with the Cleveland Browns now retired) was suspended for three games

Vilmas suspension took effect immediately while the other three players are allowed to attend training camp In announcing the suspensions Goodell said that while a large number of players took part in the program he chose to suspend those players who "were in leadership positions at the Saints; contributed a particularly large sum of money toward the program; specifically contributed to a bounty on an opposing player; demonstrated a clear intent to participate in a program that potentially injured opposing players; sought rewards for doing so; and/or obstructed the 2010 investigation" The NFL determined that Vilma and Smith helped Williams start the bounty program Hargrove lied to league officials during the 2010 investigation but later signed a letter to the NFL admitting that he was an active participant in the scheme He also told at least one other player that the Saints had put a bounty on Favre in the 2009 NFC title game Fujita who left the team for the Browns immediately after the Saints won Super Bowl XLIV pledged "a significant amount of money" into the bounty program

Earlier Goodell had indicated that he was going to come down hard on the players involved telling Eisen that they "enthusiastically embraced" the scheme "They are on the field so I dont think they are absolved from any responsibility because of that" he said

The NFLPA released a statement calling the suspensions unjustified claiming that Goodell had not furnished them with any evidence supporting the sanctions Goodell issued the suspensions as part of his power to sanction any "conduct detrimental to the integrity and public confidence in the NFL" a violation of Article 46 of the CBA This provision is normally used to sanction offfield conduct However a league source told CBSSportscoms Judge that it also gives Goodell the power to rule on ingame conduct if he feels that it runs counter to the integrity of the game

On July 26 2012 Jonathan Vilma and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal "Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying and categorically denied there was a bounty" Vilma said in a text message to ESPNs Ed Werder "Seven people testified 2 sworn affidavits all saying the same thing I ask that you and ESPN report the facts No more bias or bs or hearsay I gave you facts that you can report if so choose" Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said "Clearly the judge by her questions indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly The NFLs retort is that with all due deference you dont get to second guess (Goodell) Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues"

All four players appealed their suspensions On September 7 2012 the Burbank appeals panel vacated the suspensions imposed on the four and the NFL confirmed that the ruling reinstated them in time for their first games of the 2012 season two days later Two days after the fifth game of the season on October 9 2012 the league reissued the suspensions without any changes or reductions; the players appeals continued

On October 27 2012 former league commissioner Paul Tagliabue postponed the bounty appeals hearing expecting to set a new schedule on October 29 2012 On December 11 with three games left in the regular season Tagliabue vacated the players suspensions saying in his ruling "I affirm Commissioner Goodells factual findings as to the four players I conclude that Hargrove Smith and Vilma—but not Fujita—engaged in conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football " He laid primary responsibility for the scandal on Williams and Payton

Had the suspensions of Vilma and Hargrove been upheld they would have been the longest for an onfield incident in modern NFL history topping the previous record set in 2006 NFL season
Vilma played the final 11 games of the 2012 season for the Saints; Smith played all 16 Fujita played the first four games of the season for the Browns before suffering a seasonending (and ultimately careerending) neck injury; he would sign a ceremonial oneday contract with the Saints in the offseason and retire with the team Hargrove signed as a free agent by the Green Bay Packers in March 2012 did not play during the 2012 season Nonetheless the loss of Payton combined with the distractions caused by the scandal proved too much for the Saints to overcome After finishing 13–3 and reaching the Divisional round of the playoffs a year earlier they finished 7–9 and missed the playoffs

Media reaction
The behavior detailed in the report was almost universally condemned in the press In an editorial New Orleans local paper The TimesPicayune called the revelations "an embarrassment for one of the most successful and beloved sports organizations of recent years" and that they were "particularly hard to take for (Saints) fans" in light of the Saints rebound after Hurricane Katrina ESPN columnist Gregg Easterbrook claimed that the Saints behavior threatened the very integrity of the sport since high school and youth players have long emulated what they see in the NFL He also claimed that NFL Network yanked its planned replay of the 2009 NFC Championship Game due to concern that fans might look more closely for late hits that should have been called

Most of the players who were the targets of questionable hits by the Saints including Favre and Warner claimed the bounties were merely part of the game (Seau would commit suicide less than two months after the interview was published; it was discovered after his death that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) as a result of the numerous head injuries Seau suffered during his 20year NFL career) Seaus sentiments were echoed by Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton In an oped for The Wall Street Journal Tarkenton wrote that he played against the likes of Mean Joe Greene Ray Nitschke and Dick Butkus and none of them even considered deliberately trying to hurt him He also said that he discussed the issue with several players from his era and they unanimously agreed that players who put bounties on opponents were "cowards"

Kevin Seifert who blogs on the NFC North for ESPNcom wrote that neither he nor most Vikings fans were surprised at the discovery of the bounty program Seifert argued that even before the findings were revealed it was obvious that the Saints were determined to inflict a severe beating on Favre even if it meant breaking the rules The only difference in Seiferts mind was that he no longer believed the Saints were out of control Rather he wrote they were acting as "part of a larger mentality" instilled by Williams

Speculation quickly abounded about how severely Goodell who has made player safety and the overall integrity of the game a point of emphasis during his six years as commissioner would punish Williams and the Saints In his weekly "Monday Morning Quarterback" column on March 5 SIs Peter King (sportswriter)
After the sanctions were announced CBSSportscoms Gregg Doyel wrote that the severity of the punishments handed down to Williams Payton and Loomis proved that Goodell was truly sincere in his desire to "take the thuggishness out of the NFL" Doyel also said that while many players had chafed at what they saw as Goodells heavyhanded approach to discipline he was actually standing up for their safety in the Saints case Pereira now an analyst for Fox Sports wrote that based on his experience in the league office he wasnt surprised that Goodell came down hard on the Saints He recalled that Goodell was always upset when officials didnt penalize hits on defenseless players

The revelation of Williams pregame speech was also greeted with revulsion ESPN NFL analyst and former Dallas Cowboys safety Darren Woodson said that much of Williams speech was standard pregame rhetoric According to Woodson when Williams called for his men to "attack the head" of running back Frank Gore he was saying that the 49ers offense would be rendered ineffective if they managed to shut Gore down However Woodson felt that several parts of Williams speech—particularly his calls to go after Crabtrees ACL and target Williams specifically because he had concussions in the past—went too far His former teammate NFL Network analyst Michael Irvin said that he "almost threw up" when he heard Williams tell his men to go after Crabtrees ACL saying that players are taught from youth football onward to "never take out a mans knees" Fox Sports Mark Kriegel argued that the tape proved Williams was "woefully underpunished" especially since he made the speech after being alerted that the NFL had reopened its investigation He called for Goodell to ban him from the league for life

NFL Network analyst Michael Lombardi (sportscaster)
Despite the media outcry an independent study speculated that Saints players may have pretended to participate off the field but not put the tactics into action on the field "If the Saints tended to injure more players then teams that played them would tend to list more injuries the following week To test whether the Saints injured more players than a typical team one need only compare the number of players added to injury reports after a Saints game to the leaguewide average Did the New Orleans Saints injure more players? The datadriven answer is a resounding no The Saints appear to have injured far fewer players over the 2009 2010 and 2011 seasons The numbers are striking"
