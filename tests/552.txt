Geological perspective correlation is a theory in geology describing geometrical regularities in the layering of sediments Seventy percent of the Earths surface are occupied by sedimentary basins – volumes consisted of sediments accumulated during million years and alternated by long interruptions in sedimentation (hiatuses) The most noticeable feature of the rock (geology)Sedimentation layers are mainly created in shallow waters of oceans seas and lakes As new layers are deposited the old ones are sinking deeper due to the weight of accumulating sediments The content of sedimentary layers (lithological and biological) their order in the sequence and  geometrical characteristics keep records of the history of the Earth of past climate sealevel and environment The identification is based on comparison of 1) physical and mineralogical characteristics of the particular layer (lithostratigraphy) or 2) petrified remnants in this layer (biostratigraphy) The similarity of layers is decreasing as the distance between the crosssections increases that leads to ambiguity of the correlation scheme that indicates which layers penetrated at different locations belong to the same body (see A) To improve the results geologists take in consideration the spatial relations between layers which restricted the number of acceptable correlations The first restriction was formulated in XVII century: the sequence of layers is the same in any crosssection  The second one was discovered by Haites in 1963: In an undisturbed sequence of layers (strata) the thicknesses (H1 and H2) of any layer observed in two different locations obey the law of perspective (geometry)
 Overview  
File:Anticline trapsvgThe geometry is the main lead to natural resources explorationFile:LithocorrelationpngThe challenge is identifying in each well the interval that belongs to the same layer now or in the past (see A) To do this geologists use all available characteristics of the layer Only after this it is possible to begin the recovery of the geometry of the layer (to be more precise – the geometry of the top and bottom surfaces of the layer) This procedure is called geological correlation

 Basics of geological correlation  
The Danish scientist Nicolas Steno (1638–1686) is credited with three principles of sedimentation
 superposition: in undeformed stratigraphic sequences the oldest strata will be at the bottom of the succession
 original horizontality: layers of sediment are originally deposited horizontally
 lateral continuity: layers of sediments initially extend laterally in all directions
The principles 1 allows defining the temporary relations between neighboring geological bodies the principle 2 organizes the geometrical pattern of the succession of layers the principle 3 helps uniting the parts of the layer found in separated geological crosssections
Practical correlation has a lot of difficulties: fuzzy borders of the layers variations in composition and structure of the rocks in the layer unconformities in the sequence of layers etc This is why errors in correlation schemes are not seldom When the distances between available crosssections are decreasing (for example by drilling new wells) the quality of correlation is improving but meanwhile the wrong geological decisions could be made that increases the expenses of geological projects From Stenos principle of initial horizontality follows that the top borders of the layers (tops) were initially flat and remained flat until the complete succession stays undisturbed by subsequent tectonic movements but no regularities about the geometric relations between these flat surfaces in the succession were known The first to shed light on the problem was Canadian geologist Binner Heites: in 1963 he published the Geological Perspective Correlation hypothesis Perspective geological correlation is a theory that establishes strong geometrical restrictions on the geometry of the layers in sedimentary deposits

Perspective geometry in undisturbed succession of layers 
File:Haites perspective correlationpngIn 1963 the Canadian geologist Binner Heites discovered a strong regularity of the layering in sedimentary basins: the thicknesses of layers within each stratigraphic unit are governed by the law of  perspective (geometry)For geological purposes more convenient geometrical presentation of perspective relations is the correlation plot proposed by Jekhowsky (see C): the depths of the layers borders in one geologic crosssection are plotted along axis h′ (h1′ h2′ h3′) and the position of the same layers in another  crosssection are plotted along axis h′′ (h1′′ h2′′ h3′′ ) Points 1 2 3   with coordinates (h1′ h1′′) (h2′ h2′′) and (h3′ h3′′) accordingly are called correlation points and a curve drawn through these points a correlation line Black dots (connectors) represent the relative position of correlated borders on the plot When the layers geometry satisfies the conditions of perspective correspondence the correlation line is a straight line In the particular case of parallel layers  the inclination of the correlation line is 45<sup>0</sup> 
The Perspective Geological Correlation also states that 
each sedimentary basin consists of a number of stratigraphic units (sequence of layers without unconformities) and
in each unit the relations between the thicknesses of the layers in two crosssections  satisfy the perspective geometry conditions with individual ratios K

Heites also concludes that all strata in each unit were governed by the same rate of deposition and their borders are synchronous timeplanes  Each layer has different thicknesses in different locations but they lasted equally long It was a significant input in chronostratigraphy

The following are consequences of the basic statements:
  In different stratigraphic horizons the slopes of the correlation lines are different  
 If two adjacent sections have the same slope then both sections belong to the same stratigraphic horizon  The gap between the lines indicates a fault    
 If on the correlation line that presents the undisturbed stratigraphic succession one correlation point doesnt fit the line it means that<br>a) the correlation of the tops of the corresponding layer is wrong or<br>       b) lithologic replacement

 Connections to traditional lithostratigraphy  
The Perspective Geological Correlation is well grounded in traditional geology The method of convergence maps serves for determining the structure of the layer based on the known structure of the layers lying above It is based on the assumption that the layers are close to parallel Convergence map shows lines of equal distance (Isopach map
 Testing 
File:One stratigraphic unitpng	The description of the theory was supplied by a number of cases in support of the theory
 The plot (D) shows the correlation plot for two wells in Alberta (Canada): Innisfail 158351W5 and Innisfail 73325lW5  The crosssection of Innisfail field contains a middle Proterozoic to Paleocene sedimentary succession in excess of 6&nbsp;km in thickness The graph shows that the relations between thicknesses of all corresponding layers in these two crosssections are located on the straight line ie submit to the law of geometrical perspective with the same perspective ratio K The markers are from conventional correlation schemeThe deviation of the correlation points from the straight line is about 5 feet on average    File:300 miles apartpng
 The plot (E) demonstrates that Perspective Geological Correlation works at long distances as well The plot shows the correlation between two wells in Canada 300 miles apart (Saskatchewan and Manitoba) in SilurOrdovician carbonates  (the tilt angle 53<sup>0</sup> corresponds to K  16)

File:Tatarstan 3 wellspngA group of Russian scientists (Guberman Ovchinnikova Maximov) positively tested Heites hypothesis in different oilbearing province using the computer program (in Central Asia VolgaUral province West and East Siberia and Russian Platform)  For example see plot (F) The activity of this group continued in  2000th and covers new geological provinces around the globe Canada Kansas Louisiana South Welsh  O Karpenko demonstrated  an effective use of perspective correlation in resolving very practical problems of oil exploration The law of perspective accordance  allowed to discover the boundaries of changing the paleotectonic regime in the thinlayered sedimentary rocks while the regular correlation technic didnt work At the example of Rubanivsk gas field author demonstrated that the Dashava deposits of Precarpathian External Zone depression can be divided into number of zones of stable sediment accumulation in different conditions Some zones correlate with the intervals of enhanced gas flow rate<br> 
These works show that
the hypothesis is correct in the wide variety of geological conditions 
it works at long distances
it can serve as a solid test for stratigraphic schemes made by geologists  
it reviles the unconformity of layers as small as 1°  (G–I) and faults with  the amplitude of displacement as small as 1–2 m (G–II) 
the number of correctly correlated tops in the stratigraphic unit without unconformities has to be not less than three and as bigger is this number the bigger is the reliability of the result
it is an instrument for correcting the mistakes File:Fault+unconformitypng
Since the publication of Heites theory in 1963 it was republished in a number of reviews on quantitative methods of correlation (including automatic correlation) Some of the reports (Hansen Salin Barinova) demonstrate that the perspective correlation allowed to achieve better reconstruction of the geological structure at the early stages of geological exploration Hansen describes the controversial history of investigating the complicated  Patapsco formation in Maryland and Virginia (USA) and claims that “an adaptation of Heites (1963) technique of perspective correlation is used to subdivide the Patapsco Formation into consistently defied mapping units” Salin was able to simplify the stratigraphic description of Khatyr depression (Siberia) by applying perspective correlation Because of the high resolving power of the method it was recognized the existence of a number of geological faults that break the leakproofness Because of small displacements of the faults they were not found by the traditional methods of correlation and rejected by the geological service of the project Very soon after the storage started functioning significant leakage of gas was recognized<ref>Lobanova A Efficiency of Creation and Operation Underground Storages

 Extension to biostratigraphy 
File:Ideal LOCpngIn 1964 Shaw proposed the method of correlating fossiliferous stratigraphic profiles using the twoaxis graph (H) The markers on each axis are the observed depths of lowest (FAD) and highest (LAD) occurrences of a specially defined group of fossils (taxon
In every stratigraphic interval correlated ends of the range (FAD or LAD) belong to the same time surface and in each geological crosssection (well or outcrop) this interval has identical duration but different thickness It means that accumulation rates (thicknesstoduration ratio  tg β) are different in different locations From the fact that the relation of durations of the units and their thicknesses are linear follows that in the limits of the linear section of LOC all strata have the same accumulation rate

The reliability and accuracy of Shaws method have been tested by Edwards using a computer simulation on hypothetical data sets and by Rubel and Pak in terms of the formal logic and stochastic theory

The graphical correlation became a very important tool of stratigraphy in coal and oil industries

In 1988 Nemec showed the equivalence of Haites perspective correlation and Shaws graphical correlation

 Sedimentation model  
File:Fan patternpngFile:Rotation axispngFile:Tatarstan 2 plainspngBased on the theory of perspective correlation in 1986 S Guberman proposed a model of the process of sedimentation According Haites’ theory in the given sedimentary basin in each stratigraphic unit the condition of perspective correspondence are satisfied in any pair of wells  From this follows that the tops and bases of the layers in this stratigraphic unit satisfy the conditions of perspective correspondence in 3D space (K) Any three points of a plane define the complete plane It means that if in three wells  the thicknesses of layers belonging to the same stratigraphic unit are known then the thicknesses of these layers can be calculated for any location in the basin Accordingly if the structure of the top border of the stratigraphic unit is known the structure of any other border in this unit can be calculated
The model of creating such sophisticated geometrical pattern is based on the first Stenos principle: the strata are originally horizontal ie are planes It occurs in the shallow waters due to the turbulence of the undersurface layer of water The second Stenos principle which indicates the creation of a series of sedimentary layers lying on top of each others supposes the subsidence of the basin The sinking of the basin follows the strong geometrical restrictions: the tectonic bloc which carry the basin is rotating around the straight line parallel to the water surface and located  onshore (L) As a result until the moment of main tectonic disturbance all borders of the layers remain flat and the geometrical interrelations are described as perspective correspondence In the future the tectonic movements will distort the shape of the layers – the borders will no more be planes but in majority of cases the changes are smooth and the perspective relations are maintained
This model allows specifying some geological terms The Stenos horizontality principle has to state: the top surface of the sediments is horizontalThe conformity is a fundamental notion in stratigraphy Until now this term is used in two different meanings: a surface between two stratigraphic sequances and the relationship between two stratigraphic units Sometimes both were used in the same paragraph (see page 84)Perspective correlation principle allows to define the notion of conformity: sequence of layers that obey the conditions of geometrical perspective is a unit of conformity Two neighboring units of conformity are in relation of unconformity  <br>
	Here is an example that shows that the borders of undisturbed stratigraphic unit in the Middle Carboniferous  (VolgaUral oil province Russia) initially were plains In the central part of the area (about 100&nbsp;km in diameter) were chosen three wells at distances of 10 – 15&nbsp;km  The three tops of the stratigraphic unit  in the three wells are points in 3D space with coordinates  x y z where x and y are present the position of the well on the surface (M) and z is the thickness of the stratigraphic unit  in this location They  determine the top plain of the unit as it was at the time of its creation The three bases determine the bottom plane of the unit at it was at the same time  This allowed calculating the thickness of the stratigraphic unit at any point in the area Because the area was well enough drilled the calculated numbers can be compared with the real numbers The average difference equals 2%
