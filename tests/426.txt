Gideon Shelach claimed that Chinese texts tended to overstate the distinction between the Chinese and their northern neighbours ignoring many intergroup similarities Nicola di Cosmo doubted the existence of a strong demarcation between the "Zhou Universe" and "a discrete barbarian nonZhou universe" and claimed that Chinese historian Sima Qian popularised this concept writing of the "chasm that had always existed between China – the HuaHsia Huaxia people – and the various alien groups inhabiting the north"

The conclusion of the Warring States period brought the first unified Chinese state—established by the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE—who established the imperial system and Chinese charactersUnification: seal script vulgar writing and protoclerical
The Han Chinese civilisation Chinese cultural sphere
Throughout history Chinese frontiers had been periodically attacked by nomadic tribes from the north west and even south These people were being labelled as barbarians by the Chinese who believed themselves to be more refined and who had begun to Civilization
Although China had been trading goods to and from Europeans for centuries it was not until the arrival of the industrialised European trade and colonialism in the 19th and 20th centuries that exposed Chinese civilisation to technological developments that had long outdated Chinas As such Chinese society was forced to undergo a modification of its traditional views of its relationships with "barbarians" and in particular could no longer regard everyone other than Chinese as objectively inferior uncultured barbarians 

China
Confucius lived during a time of war between Chinese states He regarded people who did not respect Li (Confucianism)
The Disposition of Error a fifthcentury tract defending Buddhism notes that when Confucius was threatening to take residence among the nine barbarian states (
The prominent Shuowen Jiezi character dictionary (121 CE) defines yi as "level; peaceful" (
Zhou dynasty
The Bamboo Annals record that the founder of Zhou King Wu of Zhou "led the lords of the western barbarians" on a journey to conquer the Shang dynasty leading to the creation of the Zhou Dynasty The Zhou would later contribute as much as the Shang to the Hua–Yi distinction

Not all Zhou regarded the Hua–Yi distinction as a cultural barrier that needed to be overcome to purify China Zhou philosopher Mencius believed that Confucian practices were universal and timeless and thus followed by both Hua and Yi people "Emperor Shun
Jin dynasty
In order to alleviate the shortages of labour caused by the Three Kingdoms wars the Jin allowed millions of "barbarian" people to reside in Jin territory Many officials opposed this decision in the name of the Hua–Yi distinction claiming that if the barbarians did not identify with the Huaxia they would conspire to destroy the empire

Ran Mins order to kill the "barbarians"



In 349 or 350 CE (disputed) the Han general Ran Min seized power from the last emperor of the Later Zhao
Ran Min continues to be a controversial figure He is considered by some to be a hero whereas others believe he bore extreme prejudice arising from the Hua–Yi distinction

Northern Wei dynasty
Emperor Shaowu of Northern Wei (a state that controlled the north of China) who was of the Xianbei people attempted to eliminate Yi from his state by imposing Sinicization
Sui dynasty
In 581 the Sui emperor Emperor Wen of Sui
Tang dynasty
During the Tang dynasty various ethnic groups including Koreans Indians and Tibetans journeyed to Changan and other major Tang cities for business or study These people brought their religions and customs: Buddhism Islam Zoroastrianism (Xianjiao) Manichaeism (Monijiao) and Syriac Christianity (Jingjiao) all of which flourished

This cosmopolitan policy caused controversy among the literati many of whom questioned the recommendation of the Kaifeng governor for the participation of Arabborn Li Yansheng in the 847 imperial examinations and several similar incidences of what they believed as incorrect racial privileging Such was the discourse that Tang intellectual Chen An wrote an essay defending the governors decision; The Heart of Being Hua () which is often cited as expressing the sentiments of the "nonxenophobic" Chinese position on the Hua–Yi distinction In the essay Chen wrote: "If one speaks in terms of geography then there are Hua and Yi But if one speaks in terms of education then there can be no such difference For the distinction between Hua and Yi rests in the heart and is determined by their different inclinations"

A prominent Tang Confucian Han Yu wrote in his essay Yuan Dao "When Confucius wrote the Chunqiu he said that if the feudal lords use the Yi ritual then they should be called Yi If they use Chinese rituals then they should be called Chinese" Han Yu went on to lament that the Chinese of his time might all become Yi because the Tang court wanted to put Yi laws above the teachings of the former kings creating the possibility that although insiders could lose their culture outsiders could similarly gain insider culture

Arguments that excoriated the Tangs lax attitude towards foreigners were strengthened by the Yiled An Lushan Rebellion (755–763) which propelled the Tang into decline An intellectual movement "to return to the pure sources of orthodox thought and morality" including many of the concepts of the Classical Prose Movement also targeted "foreign" religions as exemplified by Han Yus diatribe against Buddhism Emperor Wenzong of Tang passed decrees in line with these views especially restricting Iranian religions and Buddhism but this policy was relaxed by his successors

Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms
The "Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms" was a period in which the north of China was ruled by a nonHan people the Shatuo for three shortlived dynasties while the south was ruled by ethnic Han Their legitimacy was recognised by the Song dynasty

Song dynasty
The Song dynasty saw both an economic boom and invasion by alien states States like the Liao dynasty and Western Xia began to take territories inhabited by large numbers of Chinese and asserted that they too were Chinese and successors to the Tang and posed legitimacy issues for Song rule

In response to rising concerns from citizenry and claims from Yi states such as the Western Xia Song scholars stipulated that groups like the Shatuo (whom the Song largely succeeded and who largely continued the rule of the Tang) were not barbarian or "Yi" but Chinese or "Hua" and that the Song had only descended from ruling groups that were Hua Secondly the Song asserted that the Liao and Western Xia and later the Jin dynasty (1115–1234)
Yuan dynasty
Concerns over legitimacy were not limited to the Song alone: states rose up again in the Yuan dynasty as its rulers were nonHan Chinese
Despite this the Yuan racially segregated their people; dividing society into four categories:
 Mongols: the ruling group and hence the most important
 Semu ("assorted categories"): a term for nonChinese and nonMongol foreigners who occupied the second slate;
 Han Chinese Southerner (南人): a term for Han Chinese under the rule of the Song dynasty

In addition the Yuan also divided society into 10 castes based on "desirability":
 High officials (官)
 Minor officials (吏)
 Buddhist monks (僧)
 Taoist priests (道)
 Physicians (医)
 Peasants (農)
 Hunters (獵)
 Courtesans (妓)
 Confucian scholars (儒)
 Beggars (丐)

The Yuan rulers were ethnic Mongols and were viewed as barbaric by the dominant Han population although they did not last long in China proper (from 1271 to 1368)

Ming dynasty
In 1368 Zhu Yuanzhang proclaimed the Ming dynasty and issued a long manifesto in which he labeled the Yuan as barbarians who had usurped the Chinese throne and who had inflicted atrocities such as rape and murder He lists incidents where the Mongols massacred men in entire villages and appropriated the women Zhus northern military expedition had been a success; Beijing was captured in the same year and China was again governed by ethnic Han

Although the Ming referred to the preceding Yuan as the "wild Yuan" (胡元) they also accepted the Yuan before them as a legitimate dynasty Hongwu Emperor indicated on another occasion that he was happy to be born in the Yuan period and that the Yuan did legitimately receive the Mandate of Heaven to rule over China In addition one of his key advisors Liu Ji generally supported the idea that while the Chinese and the nonChinese are different they are actually equal Liu was therefore arguing against the idea that Hua was and is superior to Yi

During the Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)
Towards the end of the Ming dynasty Ming loyalists invoked the HuaYi distinction to urge the Chinese to resist the Manchu people
Qing dynasty
The Qing dynastys order that all subjects shave their forehead and braid the rest of their hair into a Queue (hairstyle)
Scholar Lü Liuliang (1629–1683) who lived through the transition between the Ming and the Manchuled Qing dynasty refused to serve the new dynasty because he claimed that upholding the difference between Huaxia and the Yi was more important than respecting the righteous bond between minister (臣) and sovereign (君王) In 1728 failed Imperial examination candidate Zeng Jing (Qing dynasty)
The Yongzheng Emperor also borrowed from Han Yu indicating that Yi can become Hua and vice versa In addition according to Yongzheng both Hua and Yi were now a part of the same family under the Qing One of the goals of the tract Dayi juemi lu (大義覺迷錄) which the Yongzheng Emperor published and distributed throughout the empire in 1730 was "to undermine the credibility of the hua/yi distinction" However due to the fact that this tract also helped to expose many unsavoury aspects of court life and political intrigues in the imperial government Yongzhengs successor the Qianlong Emperor (r 1736–1796) recalled the tracts and had them burned for the fear that it would undermine the legitimacy of the Qing empire

During the Qing the Qing destroyed writings that criticised the Liao Jin and Yuan using the Hua–Yi distinction

Sun Yatsen also used the Hua–Yi distinction to justify the overthrow of the Qing dynasty

However the Qing adopted Confucian philosophy and Han Chinese institutions to show that the Manchu rulers had received the Mandate of Heaven while at the same time trying to retain their own indigenous culture Due to the Manchus adoption of Han Chinese culture most Han Chinese (though not all) accepted the Manchus as the legitimate rulers

Republic of China
Historian Frank Dikötter (1990:420) says the Chinese "idea of race (zhong 種 "seed" "species" "race") started to dominate the intellectual scene" in the late 19thcentury Qing dynasty and completed the "transition from cultural exclusiveness to racial exclusiveness in modern China" in the 1920s

Following the overthrow of the Qing Sun Yatsen allegedly went to the grave of Zhu Yuanzhang and told him that the Huaxia had been restored and the barbarians overthrown However after the Republic of China (1912–49)
Peoples Republic of China


The PRC did not abide by the concept of the HuaYi distinction and recognised the Liao Jin Yuan and Qing as legitimate dynasties Initially the Communist Party of China
Conceptualisation of the Hua–Yi distinction in the Sinosphere



Japan
In ancient times Japan seems to have had a vassal relationship with China In 57 Emperor Guangwu of Han sent an imperial seal which mentions "King of Japan" (漢委奴國王) and in 239 Cao Rui
However in 607 Prince Shōtoku of Japan stated its perspective of being independent and equal to China in a diplomatic letter by referring to the Japanese ruler as an emperor (“日出處天子致書日沒處天子無恙云云” An emperor of where the sun rises is writing to an emperor of where the sun sets) It was taken as an insult by the Chinese emperor of the time Emperor Yang of Sui since in Hua–Yi distinction emperor is a title for the ruler of China but not for other foreign countries

Confucianism was introduced into Japan about at the same time as Buddhism but it was not encouraged to be spread as much as Buddhism was

Some Japanese philosophers like the neoConfucianists Yamaga Sokō and Aizawa Seishisai claimed that Japan was the middle kingdom (中國 Chūgoku) instead of China

Korea

galleryFollowing the 1644 Manchu conquest Joseon Koreans began to refer to themselves as Sojunghwa "Little China" () As the Joseon supported the Ming they were reported to have extended a friendliness to the Ming that they did not display to the Qing dynasty

This sentiment was in large part due to the fact that Jurchens were descended from Mohe people who were once subjects of Korean kingdoms of Goguryeo and Balhae In addition Jurchens were widely recognised as barbarians as Jurchen tribes have been raiding and pillaging the northern border regions of Korean Goryeo and Joseon kingdoms for centuries This sentiment did not disappear even after Qing completed sinicisation

Because Korea had been closely tied to Han Chinese "barbarianism ruling China" became a major issue for discussion there

As the Ming dynasty fell Korea was worried about its own security This was due to previous instances in which Ming China aided Korea such as in the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)Intervention of Ming China
Over time the Qing government exerted more power over Korea This would eventually turn Korea into a hermit kingdom to limit foreign influence

Ryūkyū

The Ryukyu Kingdom was heavily influenced by Chinese culture taking language architecture and court practices from China It also paid annual tribute to first the Ming and later Qing courts from 1374 until 1874

Vietnam

Vietnamese dynasties competed for primacy adopting the same descriptive term "central state" (Trung Quốc 中國) while Chinese were "outsiders" For example Emperor Gia Long used Trung Quốc as a name for Vietnam in 1805 Cambodia was regularly called Cao Man the country of "upper barbarians"

In the 1800s Nguyễn dynasty
As Nam tiến
Clothing was also affected by Nguyễn policies Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát ordered traditional wrappedskirt and crosscollar clothing which is very popular in Sinosphere to be replaced by Qing and Mingstyle clothing although isolated hamlets in northern Vietnam continued to wear skirts until the 1920s The ao dai was created when Tuck (sewing)
Up to 1812 the 1644 Ming Datong calendar was used by the Nguyễn in Vietnam
