Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation (1976) by Joseph Weizenbaum displays the authors ambivalence towards computer technology and lays out the case that while artificial intelligence may be possible we should never allow computers to make important decisions because computers will always lack human qualities such as compassion and wisdom

Weizenbaum makes the crucial distinction between deciding and choosing Deciding is a computational activity something that can ultimately be programmed It is the capacity to choose that ultimately makes one a human being Choice however is the product of judgment not calculation Comprehensive human judgment is able to include nonmathematical factors such as emotions Judgment can compare apples and oranges and can do so without quantifying each fruit type and then reductively quantifying each to factors necessary for mathematical comparison

The book caused disagreement with and separation from other members of the artificial intelligence research community a status the author later said hed come to take pride in
