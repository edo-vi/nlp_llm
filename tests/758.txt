Transhumanism is a philosophical and intellectual movement which advocates the enhancement of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies that can greatly enhance longevity and cognition

Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations as well as the technoethics
Another topic of transhumanist research is how to protect humanity against existential risks such as nuclear war or asteroid collision

Julian Huxley was a biologist who popularised the term transhumanism in an influential 1957 essay

Influenced by seminal works of science fiction the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives including philosophy and religion

In 2017 Penn State University Press in cooperation with philosopher Stefan Lorenz Sorgner and sociologist James Hughes (sociologist)
Transhumanism is often compared especially in the media to the Nazism
History
Precursors of transhumanism
According to Nick Bostrom Selftranscendence
Transhumanists draw upon and claim continuity from intellectual and cultural traditions such as the ancient philosophy of Aristotle or the scientific tradition of Roger Bacon In his Divine Comedy Dante Alighieri
The interweaving of transhumanist aspirations with the scientific imagination can be seen in the works of some precursors of Age of Enlightenment
In his first edition of Enquiry Concerning Political Justice
Ether Day marking a significant milestone in human history celebrated its 175th anniversary on October 16 2021 It was on this day that dentist William T G Morton achieved a groundbreaking feat by administering the first public ether anesthesia in Boston This breakthrough not only allowed for the alleviation of pain with a reasonable level of risk but also helped safeguard individuals from psychological trauma by inducing wiktionary:inconscience
There is debate about whether the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche can be considered an influence on transhumanism despite its exaltation of the Übermensch (overhuman) due to its emphasis on selfactualization rather than technological transformation

The late 19th to early 20th century movement known as Russian cosmism by Russian philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov
Early transhumanist thinking
File:HuxOxon72jpg
Fundamental ideas of transhumanism were first advanced in 1923 by the British geneticist J B S Haldane in his essay Daedalus; or Science and the Future
His article inspired academic and popular interest John Desmond Bernal
The biologist Julian Huxley is generally regarded as the founder of transhumanism after using the term for the title of an influential 1957 article The term itself however derives from an earlier 1940 paper by the Canadian philosopher W D Lighthall Huxley describes transhumanism in these terms:



<! File:2001 NALjpg >Huxleys definition differs albeit not substantially from the one commonly in use since the 1980s The ideas raised by these thinkers were explored in the science fiction of the 1960s notably in Arthur C Clarkes 2001: A Space Odyssey in which an alien artifact grants transcendent power to its wielder

Japanese Metabolist architects produced a manifesto in 1960 which outlined goals to "encourage active metabolic development of our society" through design and technology In the Metabolism (architecture)Material and Man
Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity
The concept of the technological singularity or the ultrarapid advent of superhuman intelligence was first proposed by the British cryptologist I J Good in 1965:


Computer scientist Marvin Minsky wrote on relationships between human and artificial intelligence beginning in the 1960s contributed to the conceptualization of "transhumanity" with his 1972 Man into Superman FM2030 published the Upwingers Manifesto in 1973

Growth of transhumanism
The first selfdescribed transhumanists met formally in the early 1980s at the University of California Los Angeles which became the main center of transhumanist thought Here FM2030 lectured on his "Third Way (centrism)
In 1986 K Eric Drexler


In 1992 More and Morrow founded the Extropy Institute a catalyst for networking futurists and brainstorming new memeplexes by organizing a series of conferences and more importantly providing a mailing list which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during the rise of cyberculture and the cyberdelic counterculture In 1998 philosophers Nick Bostrom and David Pearce (philosopher)
Blockquote The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual physical and psychological capacities
 The study of the ramifications promises and potential dangers of technologies that will enable us to overcome fundamental human limitations and the related study of the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies

In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their futurist visions and needed to be addressed

The Mormonism
The first transhumanist elected member of a parliament has been Giuseppe Vatinno in Italy

 Theory 
It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of posthumanism and how this philosophical movement should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism The latter is often referred to as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its Conservatism
A common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is the future vision of a new intelligent species into which humanity will evolve and eventually will supplement or supersede it Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement (ie biological uplift)

Nevertheless the idea of creating artificial intelligence
Some Secular humanism
As an alternative humanist philosopher Dwight Gilbert Jones has proposed a renewed Renaissance humanism through DNA and genome repositories with each individual genotype (DNA) being instantiated as successive phenotypes (bodies or lives via cloning Church of Man 1978) In his view native molecular DNA "continuity" is required for retaining the "self" and no amount of computing power or memory aggregation can replace the essential "stink" of our true genetic identity which he terms "genity" Instead DNA/genome stewardship by an institution analogous to the Jesuits 400 year vigil is a suggested model for enabling humanism to become our species common credo a project he proposed in his speculative novel The Humanist – 1000 Summers (2011) wherein humanity dedicates these coming centuries to harmonizing our planet and peoples

The philosophy of transhumanism is closely related to technoself studies an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society and focusing on the changing nature of relationships between humans and technology

 Aims 


File:PPTCountdowntoSingularityLogjpg
While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply reason science and technology for the purposes of reducing poverty disease disability and malnutrition around the globe transhumanism is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of biocentrism (ethics)
Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a perfectionism (philosophy)
Some theorists such as Ray Kurzweil think that the Accelerating change
While many people believe that all transhumanists are striving for immortality it is not necessarily true Hank Pellissier managing director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (2011–2012) surveyed transhumanists He found that of the 818 respondents 238% did not want immortality Some of the reasons argued were boredom Earths overpopulation and the desire "to go to an afterlife"

 Empathic fallibility and conversational consent 

Certain transhumanist philosophers hold that since all assumptions about what others experience fallibility
 Ethics 

Transhumanists engage in interdisciplinary approaches to understand and evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on futurology and various fields of ethics Unlike many philosophers social critics and activists who place a moral value on preservation of nature
A belief of countertranshumanism is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement in many areas of life but specifically on the social plane This can be compared to steroid use where athletes who use steroids in sports have an advantage over those who do not The same scenario happens when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the work place and in educational aspects The idea of two human species one being at a great physical and economic advantage in comparison with the other is a troublesome one at best One may be incapable of breeding with the other and may by consequence of lower physical health and ability be considered of a lower moral standing than the other

Nick Bostrom stated that transhumanism advocates for the wellbeing of all sentient beings whether in nonhuman animals extraterrestrials or artificial forms of life This view is reiterated by David Pearce (philosopher)
 Currents 
There is a variety of opinions within transhumanist thought Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development Some distinctive currents of transhumanism are identified and listed here in alphabetical order:
 Eradication of suffering Democratic transhumanism a political ideology synthesizing liberal democracy social democracy radical democracy and transhumanism
 Equalism (socioeconomic theory) Extropianism an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a Proactionary principle Immortalism a moral ideology based upon the belief that radical life extension and ImmortalityTechnological immortality Libertarian transhumanism a political ideology synthesizing libertarianism and transhumanism
 Postgenderism a social philosophy which seeks the voluntary elimination of gender in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and reproductive technologyPostpoliticism a transhumanist political proposal that aims to create a "PostdemocracySingularitarianism a moral ideology based upon the belief that a technological singularity is possible and advocating deliberate action to effect it and ensure its safety
 Technogaianism an ecological ideology based upon the belief that emerging technologies can help restore Earths environment and that developing safe clean technology
 Spirituality 
Although many transhumanists are atheism
Some transhumanists believe in the compatibility between the human mind and computer hardware with the theoretical implication that human consciousness may someday be transferred to alternative media (a speculative technique commonly known as mind uploading)

Viewed from the perspective of some Christian thinkers the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a Contempt for the flesh
The first dialogue between transhumanism and faith was a oneday conference held at the University of Toronto in 2004 Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor a relationship with the divinity
Since 2006 the Mormon Transhumanist Association sponsors conferences and lectures on the intersection of technology and religion The Christian Transhumanist Association was established in 2014

Since 2009 the American Academy of Religion holds a "Transhumanism and Religion" consultation during its annual meeting where scholars in the field of religious studies seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions; consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future in particular the prospect of human transformation whether by technological or other means; and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology robotics and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species

The physicist and transhumanist thinker Giulio Prisco states that "cosmist religions based on science might be our best protection from reckless pursuit of superintelligence and other risky technologies" Prisco also recognizes the importance of spiritual ideas such as the ones of Russian Orthodox philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov to the origins of the transhumanism movement

 Practice 
While some transhumanists take an abstract and theoretical approach to the perceived benefits of emerging technologies others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body including heritable ones Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human nervous system Though some such as Kevin Warwick propose modification of the peripheral nervous system the human brain
In fact Warwick has gone a lot further than merely making a proposal In 2002 he had a 100 electrode array surgically implanted into the median nerves of his left arm to link his nervous system directly with a computer and thus to also connect with the internet As a consequence he carried out a series of experiments He was able to directly control a robot hand using his neural signals and to feel the force applied by the hand through feedback from the fingertips He also experienced a form of ultrasonic sensory input and conducted the first purely electronic communication between his own nervous system and that of his wife who also had electrodes implanted

File:Biohacker Neil HarbissonjpgAs proponents of selfimprovement and body modification transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity Depending on their age some transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies However many have a great interest in life extension strategies and in funding research in cryonics to make the latter a viable option of last resort rather than remaining an unproven method Regional and global transhumanist networks and communities with a range of objectives exist to provide support and forums for discussion and collaborative projects

While most transhumanist theory focuses on future technologies and the changes they may bring many today are already involved in the practice on a very basic level It is not uncommon for many to receive cosmetic changes to their physical form via cosmetic surgery even if it is not required for health reasons Human growth hormones attempt to alter the natural development of shorter children or those who have been born with a physical deficiency Doctors prescribe medicines such as Ritalin and Adderall to improve cognitive focus and many people take "lifestyle" drugs such as Viagra Propecia and Botox to restore aspects of youthfulness that have been lost in maturity

Other transhumanists such as cyborg artist Neil Harbisson use technologies and techniques to improve their senses and perception of reality Harbissons antenna which is permanently implanted in his skull allows him to sense colours beyond human perception such as infrareds and ultraviolets

 Technologies of interest 

Transhumanists support the emerging technologies
Some reports on the converging technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged science fictional character At the same time research on brain and body alteration technologies has been accelerated under the sponsorship of the United States Department of Defense
Neuroscientist Anders Sandberg has been practicing on the method of scanning ultrathin sections of the brain This method is being used to help better understand the architecture of the brain As of now this method is currently being used on mice This is the first step towards hypothetically uploading contents of the human brain including memories and emotions onto a computer


 Debate 
The very notion and prospect of human enhancement and related issues arouse public controversy Criticisms of transhumanism and its proposals take two main forms: those objecting to the likelihood of transhumanist goals being achieved (practical criticisms) and those objecting to the moral principles or worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying transhumanism itself (ethical criticisms) Critics and opponents often see transhumanists goals as posing threats to humanism
The human enhancement debate is for some framed by the opposition between strong bioconservatism and transhumanism The former opposes any form of human enhancement whereas the latter advocates for all possible human enhancements  However many philosophers engaged in the continuing debate hold a more nuanced view in favour of some enhancements while rejecting the transhumanist carte blanche approach

Some of the most widely known critiques of the transhumanist program are novels and fictional films These works of art despite presenting imagined worlds rather than philosophical analyses are used as touchstones for some of the more formal arguments

On another front some authors consider that humanity is already transhuman because medical advances in recent centuries have significantly altered our species However it is not in a conscious and therefore transhumanistic way From such perspective transhumanism is perpetually aspirational: as new technologies become mainstream the adoption of new yetunadopted technologies becomes a new shifting goal

 Feasibility 
In a 1992 book sociologist Max Dublin pointed to many past failed predictions of technological progress and argued that modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate He also objected to what he saw as scientism fanaticism and nihilism by a few in advancing transhumanist causes Dublin also said that historical parallels existed between Millenarianism
Although generally sympathetic to transhumanism public health professor Gregory Stock is skeptical of the technical feasibility and mass appeal of the cyborgization of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil Hans Moravec and Kevin Warwick He said that throughout the 21st century many humans would find themselves deeply integrated into systems of machines but would remain biological Primary changes to their own form and character would arise not from cyberware but from the direct manipulation of their genetics metabolism and biochemistry

In her 1992 book Science as Salvation philosopher Mary Midgley traces the notion of achieving immortality by Selftranscendence
Another critique is aimed mainly at "algeny" (a portmanteau of alchemy and genetics) which Jeremy Rifkin defined as "the upgrading of existing organisms and the design of wholly new ones with the intent of perfecting their performance" It emphasizes the issue of biocomplexity and the unpredictability of attempts to guide the development of products of biological evolution This argument elaborated in particular by the biologist Stuart Newman is based on the recognition that somatic cell nuclear transfer
As a practical matter however international protocols on human subject research may not present a legal obstacle to attempts by transhumanists and others to improve their offspring by germinal choice technology According to legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky existing laws would protect parents who choose to enhance their childs genome from future liability arising from adverse outcomes of the procedure

Transhumanists and other supporters of human genetic engineering do not dismiss practical concerns out of hand insofar as there is a high degree of uncertainty about the timelines and likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans However bioethicist James Hughes (sociologist)
Thinkers who defend the likelihood of accelerating change point to a past pattern of exponential increases in humanitys technological capacities Kurzweil developed this position in his 2005 book The Singularity Is Near

 Intrinsic immorality 
It has been argued that in transhumanist thought humans attempt to substitute themselves for God The 2002 Holy See
Other critics target what they claim to be an instrumental conception of the human body in the writings of Marvin Minsky Hans Moravec and some other transhumanists Reflecting a strain of feminism
Nick Bostrom responds that the desire to rejuvenation (aging)
 Loss of human identity 
File:Amish vs modern transportationjpg
In his 2003 book Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age environmental ethics
Biopolitical activist Jeremy Rifkin and biologist Stuart Newman accept that biotechnology has the power to make profound changes in organismal identity They argue against the genetic engineering of human beings because they fear the blurring of the boundary between human and Cultural artifact
Science journalist Ronald Bailey claims that McKibbens historical examples are flawed and support different conclusions when studied more closely For example few groups are more cautious than the Amish about embracing new technologies but though they shun television and use horses and buggies some are welcoming the possibilities of gene therapy since inbreeding has afflicted them with a number of rare genetic diseases Bailey and other supporters of technological alteration of human biology also reject the claim that life would be experienced as meaningless if some human limitations are overcome with enhancement technologies as extremely subjective

Writing in Reason (magazine)
A different response comes from transhumanist personhood theory
At least one public interest organization the USbased Center for Genetics and Society was formed in 2001 with the specific goal of opposing transhumanist agendas that involve transgenerational modification of human biology such as fullterm human cloning and germinal choice technology The Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future of the ChicagoKent College of Law critically scrutinizes proposed applications of genetic and nanotechnologies to human biology in an academic setting


 Socioeconomic effects 
Some critics of libertarian transhumanism have focused on the likely socioeconomic consequences in societies in which economic inequality
These criticisms are also voiced by criticism of libertarianism
Sometimes as in the writings of Leon Kass the fear is that various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed In his 2002 book Our Posthuman Future and in a 2004 Foreign Policy (magazine)
In a 2004 article in the libertarian monthly Reason (magazine)
 Cultural aesthetics 
In addition to the socioeconomic risks and implications of transhumanism there are indeed implications and possible consequences in regard to cultural aesthetics Currently there are a number of ways in which people choose to represent themselves in society The way in which a person dresses hair styles and body alteration all serve to identify the way a person presents themselves and is perceived by society According to Foucault society already governs and controls bodies by making them feel watched This "surveillance" of society dictates how the majority of individuals choose to express themselves aesthetically

One of the risks outlined in a 2004 article by Jerold Abrams is the elimination of differences in favor of universality This he argues will eliminate the ability of individuals to subvert the possibly oppressive dominant structure of society by way of uniquely expressing themselves externally Such control over a population would have dangerous implications of tyranny Yet another consequence of enhancing the human form not only cognitively but physically will be the reinforcement of "desirable" traits which are perpetuated by the dominant social structure Physical traits which are seen as "ugly" or "undesirable" and thus deemed lessthan will be summarily cut out by those who can afford to do it while those who cannot will be forced into a relative caste of undesirable people Even if these physical "improvements" are made completely universal they will indeed eliminate what makes each individual uniquely human in their own way

 Specter of coercive eugenicism 
Some critics of transhumanism see the old eugenics social Darwinist and master race ideologies and programs of the past as warnings of what the promotion of eugenic enhancement technologies might unintentionally encourage Some fear future "Biopolitics
The major transhumanist organizations strongly condemn the coercion involved in such policies and reject the scientific racism
 Existential risks 


In his 2003 book Our Final Hour British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees argues that advanced science and technology bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress However Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity Instead he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness Advocates of the precautionary principle such as many in the environmental movement also favor slow careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas Some precautionists believe that artificial intelligence and robotics present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life

Transhumanists do not necessarily rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of existential risk Generally however they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often technorealism
Nick Bostrom argues that even barring the occurrence of a singular Global catastrophic risk
One transhumanist solution proposed by Bostrom to counter existential risks is control of differential technological development a series of attempts to influence the sequence in which technologies are developed In this approach planners would strive to retard the development of possibly harmful technologies and their applications while accelerating the development of likely beneficial technologies especially those that offer protection against the harmful effects of others

 Antinatalism 
Although most people zoom in on the technological and scientific barriers on the road to transhumanist enhancement Robbert Zandbergen argues that contemporary transhumanists failure to critically engage the movement of antinatalism is a far larger obstacle to a better future Antinatalism is the movement to restrict or terminate human reproduction as the final means to solve our existential problems If transhumanists fail to take this threat to human perseverance seriously they run the risk of collapsing the entire edifice of radical enhancement
