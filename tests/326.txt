The Historiography of the Nanjing Massacre is the representation of the events of the Nanjing Massacre as history in various languages and cultural contexts in the years since these events took place This historiography is disparate and sometimes contested owing to conflicting currents of Chinese nationalism
Japaneselanguage historiography on the subject has ranged from nationalistrevisionist accounts which completely deny Imperial Japanese culpability in war crimes to leftist critics of militarism who prefer to center the narrative on the accounts of Chinese survivors of the events Although Japanese revisionist accounts which have sometimes arisen in the context of Japanese domestic politics have been controversial particularly in China the Japaneselanguage historiographical material regarding the massacre has featured much diverse and sophisticated research

In contrast to the Japanese research that have been ongoing since the late 1950s Chineselanguage research has for a long time been hindered by the limitations on free speech in mainland China much of the secondary material merely agreed on the government statement 
of the day making it difficult to describe the situation as a "debate"

While mainly written by nonacademic lay authors revisionist works of the Nanjing Massacre in Japan have been increasingly vocal in the past years and have caused international disputes and stoked nationalist tensions Despite many failed attempts for a collaboration Japan and China have been unable to agree upon the Death toll of the Nanjing Massacre
SinoJapanese War

During the war the Japanese Government kept tight control over the news media  As a result the Japanese public was not aware of the Nanjing Massacre or other war crimes committed by the Japanese military The Japanese military was rather portrayed as a heroic entity  Japanese officials lied about civilian death figures at the time of the Nanjing Massacre and some Japanese Uyoku dantai
One brief lapse in the Japanese governments control over negative depictions of the war was the fleeting public distribution of Tatsuzō Ishikawas wartime novel Living Soldier (Ikiteiru heitai) which depicted the grim and dehumanizing effects of the war Ishikawa and his publisher tried to satisfy government censors by a deliberate decision to selfcensor lines about soldiers "foraging for fresh meat" and "searching for women like dogs chasing a rabbit" while still preserving the overall tone and import of the novel The novel was published in 1938 but was pulled from circulation within days; Ishikawa was sentenced to a fourmonth prison term for disturbing "peace and order"

Controversy and confusion over the Nanjing massacre occurred even soon after in 1943 George Orwell wrote in Looking Back on the Spanish War: "Recently I noticed that the very people who swallowed any and every horror story about the Japanese in  in 1937 refused to believe exactly the same stories about Hong Kong in 1942 There was even a tendency to feel that the  atrocities had become as it were retrospectively untrue because the British Government now drew attention to them  There is not the slightest doubt for instance about the behaviour of the Japanese in China  The raping and butchering in Chinese cities the tortures in the cellars of the Gestapo the elderly Jewish professors flung into cesspools the machinegunning of refugees along the Spanish roads—they all happened and they did not happen any the less because The Daily Telegraph has suddenly found out about them when it is five years too late"

It was not until the Tokyo Trial (tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East) and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal
Postwar
In the 1950s author Yoshie Hotta wrote a series of pieces of historical fiction about the atrocities in Nanjing

In 1967 Tomio Hora published his seminal account "Nankin Jiken" ("Nanjing Incident") in which he refuted revisionist denial of the massacre This detailed treatment of the incident was the first meaningful and indepth description of the massacre in Japanese postwar historiography Some leftwing Japanese journalists of the decade were inspired by the American war in Vietnam to research the events

International interest in the Nanjing Massacre waned into near obscurity until 1972 the year China and Japan normalized diplomatic relations Discussion of wartime atrocities developed considerably in this period The Chinese governments statements about the events were attacked by Japanese diplomats because they relied on personal testimonies and anecdotal evidence Also coming under attack were the burial records and photographs presented in the Tokyo War Crime Court which were said to be fabrications by the Chinese government artificially manipulated or incorrectly attributed to the Nanjing Massacre

During the 1970s Japanese journalist Katsuichi Honda traveled to China to explore the wartime conduct of the Imperial Army  Based on his research in China Honda wrote a series of articles for the Asahi Shimbun on atrocities (such as the Nanjing Massacre) committed by Japanese soldiers during World War II called "Chūgoku no Tabi" (中国の旅 "Travels in China")  The publication of these articles triggered a vehement response from the Japanese right regarding Imperial Japanese war crimes  Japanese nationalist responses answering this publication included the influential articles of Shichihei Yamamoto "Reply to Katsuichi Honda" and Akira Suzuki "The Phantom of The Nanjing Massacre"

Japanese history textbooks


In 1965 Japaneselanguage textbook author Saburō Ienaga sued the Ministry of Education

The way in which the subject is taught in Japanese schools became the center of controversy in the Japanese textbook controversies of 1982 and 1986 The Nanjing Massacre "was still absent from elementary school textbooks but junior high school textbooks such as those published by Nihon shoseki and Kyōiku Shuppan in 1975 for instance mentioned that fortytwo thousand Chinese civilians including women and children were killed during the Massacre"  Two other textbooks mentioned the massacre but the four other textbooks in use in Japan did not mention it all  By 1978 the Ministry of Education removed the number killed out of all text books in use

In 1982 the Ministry of Education embarked on a campaign to reframe the presentation of the history of World War II in history textbooks History textbooks were reworded to describe the SinoJapanese War as "advancing in and out of China" instead of "aggression" which was deemed to be a more pejorative term The Nanjing Massacre was characterized as a minor incident which was sparked by the frustration of Japanese soldiers at meeting strong resistance from the Chinese Army These moves sparked strong protests from other Asian countries

In the 1990s the stance of the Japanese government began to change as three consecutive prime ministers sought reconciliation with other Asian countries by acknowledging Japans responsibility for the war

Immediately after taking office in 1993 Hosokawa Morihiro prime minister of the first nonLiberal Democratic Party government characterized Japans expansion through Asia in the 1930s and 1940s as an "aggressive war" Hosokawas two successors Hata Tsutomu and Murayama Tomiichi made similar statements

During this period officially endorsed school textbooks were rewritten to reflect this changed perspective on Japans responsibility for the war  For example of the seven history books approved in 1997 for use in junior high schools six cited a figure of 200000 as the number of people killed by the Japanese military during the capture of Nanjing; four of those books also mentioned the higher Chinese estimate of 300000 casualties

Besides total denial another line of Japanese thought insisted that the scale of the Nanjing Massacre had been exaggerated by the Chinese This view was expounded by Ikuhiko Hata in his book Nanjing Incident  Hata asserted that the number of victims in the Massacre was 38000–42000 He argued that only Chinese POWs and civilians and not Chinese soldiers killed in action on the battlefield should be counted as victims of the massacre

1980s
Chinese interest in the history of the massacre further developed in the 1980s Research of burial records and documents as well as interviews confirmed a figure of 300000 dead Chinese in the course of the massacre thus corroborating the findings of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal

In Japan a variety of new evidence was published including the private journals of commanding Japanese generals as well as those of many ordinary soldiers Official military records of a number of the Japanese units involved also became available In addition a number of Japanese veterans began openly to admit to having committed or witnessed atrocities in the Nanjing area Iris Chang mentioned important research was made out of the academic community by freelancers and reporters She cited the works of Ono Kenji a chemical factory worker who from 1988 to 1994 visited 600 households interviewed 200 persons photocopied 20 notebooks and conducted 7 video interviews Some of his researches were published in Shūkan Kinyōbi and were saluted as the first work on Nanjing Massacre solely based on Japanese sources In 1996 he coedited a book on the subject "living under the constant shadow of possible Japanese retaliation"
 
Masaaki Tanakas book "Fabrication of Nanjing Massacre" not only denied the Nanjing Massacre but laid the blame for the SinoJapanese war on the Chinese Government

In September 1986 the Japanese education minister Fujio Masayuki dismissed the Nanjing massacre as "just a part of war"

The Japanese distributor of The Last Emperor (1987) edited out the stock footage of the Nanjing massacre from the film

1990s
As far as Japanese academics are concerned the controversy over the occurrence of atrocities ended in the early 90s Both sides accept that atrocities did occur; however disagreement exists over the actual numbers  The debate is focused on the questions of whether to include archival or anecdotal evidence what time period to use in defining the massacre and what geographical area to use in defining the massacre

Chinese historical studies
In a 1990 paper entitled The Nanking Massacre and the Nanking Population Sun Zhaiwei of the Jiangsu Academy of Social Sciences estimated the total number of people killed at 377400 combining Chinese burial records and estimates totaling 150000 given by Japanese Imperial Army major Ohta Hisao in a confessional report about the Japanese armys disposal efforts of dead bodies

Denial by Japanese government officials
A number of Japanese cabinet ministers as well as some highranking politicians have made comments denying the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army in World War II  Among these were General Nagano Shigeto a World War II veteran and a former chief of staff of the Japan Ground SelfDefense Force who was appointed justice minister in spring of 1994  Shigeto told a Japanese newspaper that "the Nanjing Massacre and the rest was a fabrication"

In an interview with Playboy magazine Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara said "People say that the Japanese made a holocaust but that is not true It is a story made up by the Chinese It has tarnished the image of Japan but it is a lie" Some subsequently resigned after protests from China and South Korea

On November 10 1990 during a protest by Chinese Americans against the Japanese actions on the island of Senkaku Islands
In response to these and similar incidents a number of Japanese journalists and historians formed the Nankin Jiken Chōsa Kenkyūkai (Nanjing Incident Research Group) The research group has collected large quantities of archival materials as well as testimonies from both Chinese and Japanese sources

Apology and condolences by the prime minister and emperor of Japan

On August 15 1995 the fiftieth anniversary of the Surrender of Japan the Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama gave the first clear and formal apology for Japanese actions during the war  He apologized for Japans wrongful aggression and the great suffering that it inflicted in Asia  He offered his "heartfelt" apology to all survivors and to the relatives and friends of the victims That day the prime minister and the Japanese Emperor Akihito pronounced statements of mourning at Tokyos Nippon Budokan The emperor offered his condolences and expressed the hope that similar atrocities would never be repeated

Iris Chang

Interest in the West remained muted until the publication of Iris Changs book The Rape of Nanking (book)
Contemporary debate


Currently no notable group in Japan even among rightwing nationalists denies that killings did occur in Nanjing The debate has shifted mainly to the death toll to the extent of rapes and civilian killings (as opposed to POW and suspected guerrillas) and to the appropriateness of using the word "massacre" Massacre denialists insist that burial records from the Red Swastika Society and the Chung Shan Tang (Tsung Shan Tong) were never cross examined at the Tokyo and Nanjing trials arguing therefore that the estimates derived from these two sets of records should be heavily discounted Although they admit that personal accounts of Japanese soldiers do suggest the occurrence of rapes they insist that this anecdotal evidence cannot be used to determine the extent of rapes Moreover they characterize personal testimonies from the Chinese side to be propaganda They also point out that unlike the burial records that document the number of deaths there are no documented records of the rapes and so they argue that the allegation of mass rape is unsubstantiated Massacre denialists also assert that the majority of those killed were POWs and "suspected guerrillas" whose executions they characterize as legitimate and so they argue the use of the word "massacre" is inappropriate

However within the public the debate still continues Those downplaying the massacre have most recently rallied around a group of academic and journalists associated with the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform
In 2004 the Japanese Minister of Education expressed a desire to overcome "selftorturing" accounts of Japanese history

In 2005 2005 antiJapanese demonstrations
In 2007 a group of Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)
That same year Xia Shuqin won a defamation of character suit against Japanese massacre denialists who argued that she had fabricated testimony relating to the death of seven of her eight family members during the Nanjing Massacre Only eight at the time Xia had herself been bayoneted but survived while her fouryearold sister escaped detection under the bed quilts
