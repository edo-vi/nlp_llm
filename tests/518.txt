The 2018 Adelaide Crows preseason camp was a summer camp undertaken by players of the Adelaide Football Club from January 29 to February 2 in the leadup to the 2018 AFL season Run by Collective Mind a consultancy group based in Queensland the camp was designed to strengthen the mental toughness of the players a lack of which was blamed by Adelaides Head of Football Brett Burton and coach Don Pyke for their loss in the 2017 AFL Grand Final 

According to some reports the camp was "cultlike" and ultimately caused the departure of many senior officials including both Burton and Pyke It was said to have had the opposite of its intended team building effect and contributed to a rapid deterioration in Adelaides onfield form

Information on the events of the camp was limited until a July 2020 article by journalist Sam McClure who obtained details from various former Adelaide players In February 2022 Nine Entertainment retracted McClures July 2020 article and other camprelated publications due to a defamation lawsuit from Collective Minds However some claims in the publications were later supported or corroborated by players

Background
Having faced numerous hardships throughout previous seasons such as the murder of coach Phil Walsh (Australian footballer)
Collective Minds
Collective Minds is a consultancy group based in Queensland which is "hired by sporting teams and businesses to build a mentally resilient culture" Prior to the camp Crows players were made to sign nondisclosure agreements barring them from publicly discussing the events of the camp

Allegations about the camp
The camp run by Collective Minds and masterminded by Head of Football at Adelaide Brett Burton and Amon Woulfe a selfproclaimed "coach facilitator and trainer" who is not a registered psychologist took place in a forest about an hours drive away from Broadbeach Queensland a suburb of Gold Coast Queensland
Experience of Group 1
Upon entering the bus that was to carry them from Broadbeach to the camp Group 1 was alarmed to be greeted by men wearing combat uniforms and holding what appeared to be automatic firearms though the guns were revealed to be fake The players were then blindfolded and were driven for an hour until they arrived at the camp Upon arrival they had their blindfolds removed and were greeted by roughly 25 camp workers who refused to reveal the location at which they were Among the first exercises performed by Group 1 was an exercise in which players were told to find a partner and stare at their eyes alternating which eye they were staring at During the middle of this exercise Tom Lynch collapsed He was taken to a bed where he started to vomit Despite his condition camp workers refused to call for medical attention claiming that he was only suffering from dizziness Lynch was only given medical assistance upon the demands of the players and club doctor Marc Cesana who was not at the camp and did not know where it was located was contacted and made to drive to the location and bring Lynch back to Broadbeach to provide medical attention

Experience of Group 2 and Group 3
Groups 2 and 3 were subject to a less severe experience than Group 1 with them arriving a day after Group 1  They were not blindfolded on the drive there though they were ordered to keep their heads down for the entire trip while heavy metal music played over loudspeakers

Talking stick
During the first night of the camp all players were asked to publicly divulge their weaknesses using an Aboriginal Australian digging stick as a Talking stick Eddie Betts Cam EllisYolmen Wayne Milera and Curtly Hampton all of whom are Aboriginal found this action culturally offensive and it only contributed to their distaste for the camp Collective Minds has admitted that using the digging stick in the way that they did was a mistake

Wolfgang
According to journalist Sam McClure of The Age before sunrise on the second day of camp players were woken up and taken to a worker in the woods who introduced himself as "Wolfgang" 

While they were attempting to reach the knife nine of their teammates would hurl abuse at them This abuse was deeply personal with barbs calling back to childhood trauma relationship issues and domestic abuse that had been gleaned from info leaked to the managers of the camp without the consent of the players derived from confidential disclosures players had made to Adelaide staff Jeff Bond former Chief Psychologist for the Australian Institute of Sport told The Age that "Using peoples personal trauma to drive them is so illogical and dangerous its not funny" Bond also compared many of the measures taken in the camp to ones used for training commandos in the military Adelaide themselves have "strongly disputed" this version of events

Social interactions
Social interaction at the camp was extremely limited players were ordered not to talk with each other when not performing exercises and as all phones had been confiscated most players had zero contact with the outside world The only outside contact allowed was for players who had pregnant spouses who were allowed a few minutes a day to speak

Aftermath
The camp was not effective in improving the results of the Adelaide Football Club Adelaide had a poor 2018 season finishing 12th on the ladder and missing the 2018 AFL finals series
In September 2020 Collective Minds sued Nine Entertainment for defamation As a result Nine retracted 13 publications about the camp in February 2022

In August 2022 Eddie Betts released a biography containing previously unknown revelations about what happened at the camp In response the Adelaide Football Club publicly apologised to him Following the release of Bettss biography Josh Jenkins released a statement with further details from the camp His opposition to aspects of the camp led to him being ostracised and was the reason he left the club Bryce Gibbs also spoke out about events that transpired at the camp
