Professional career

Early career
Resto made his professional boxing debut on February 4 1977 with a points defeat of Julio Chevalier  He scored his first professional knockout in his third professional fight against Mike Lytell in May of the same year Resto remained unbeaten with a 70 record until his eighth bout a knockout loss to Bruce Curry in March 1978

Through 29 fights Resto had compiled a record of 2081 but with only eight wins by knockout which made him appear to be a lightpunching highlevel Journeyman (boxing)
Bout with Billy Collins Jr
On June 16 1983 Resto unexpectedly beat undefeated prospect Billy Collins Jr at Madison Square Garden in New York City in a 10round unanimous decision The fight was the Card (sports)Undercard
However when Collins father and trainer Billy Sr came to shake Restos hand he discovered that Restos gloves felt thinner than normal Screaming that he thought the gloves had no padding Collins Sr demanded that the New York State Athletic Commission impound the gloves An investigation revealed that someone had removed an ounce of padding from each of his gloves then filled them with chalk Collins eyes were swollen shut by the end of the 10th round and the rest of his face was so badly swollen that it was impossible to believe a light puncher could have inflicted such damage

Collins suffered a torn Iris (anatomy)
After a months investigation the New York State Boxing Commission determined that Restos trainer Panama Lewis had removed the padding from Restos gloves It also determined that Resto should have known the gloves were illegal The commission suspended Restos boxing license for at least a year Since most state boxing commissions honor sanctions from other states this effectively banned Resto from boxing in the United States for the duration of the ban  The commission subsequently changed its rules to prevent anything like what happened to Collins from ever happening again Restos win was subsequently changed to a No contest (boxing)
In 1986 Lewis and Resto were both put on trial and found guilty of assault criminal possession of a weapon (Restos hands) and conspiracy Prosecutors charged that Resto had to have known the gloves were illegal and therefore the bout amounted to an illegal 10round assault Prosecutors also argued that the plot was centered on a large amount of money bet on Resto by a third party who had met with Lewis prior to the fight  Resto served 2 and a half years in prison

After 15 years of trying to regain his license he was finally allowed to work as a cornerman by New York State

For almost a quartercentury Resto publicly denied knowing that Lewis had tampered with the gloves  However in 2007 Resto apologized to Collinss widow Andrea CollinsNile who attempted to sue the state of New York for not protecting her late husband Resto also told CollinsNile that in addition to removing padding from the gloves Lewis soaked his hand wraps in plaster
The 1983 incident and subsequent aftermath is covered in the Showtime (TV network)
