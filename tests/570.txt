Consumers United for Evidencebased Healthcare (CUE) is a coalition of health advocacy consumer groups interested in evidencebased medicine
CUE provides leadership to other efforts aimed at involving patients in the research process strengthening the voice of consumers in healthcare research which has been called for over two decades but which has not always been successfully implemented free of commercial influence By creating opportunities for networking and learning similar to those available to health professionals CUE members can be empowered and have an ongoing source of information and tools about health issues of concern This would at least in theory give the member groups an edge in advocacy activities

Since its establishment CUE members have been asked to testify on national committees contribute letters to the biomedical literature sit on national professional society steering groups and advisory panels and many other contributions

CUE Partnership Clearinghouse
In keeping with its role as a consumerscientist partnership CUE maintains a clearinghouse function which matches consumers with healthcare professional organizations so that the consumer voice may be incorporated into important healthcare decisions Past partnerships have matched consumer representatives into research implementation processes such as clinical guidelines panels grantwriting peer review and conference workshops

Through the CUE Clearinghouse health professional organizations can request consumer representatives for their research/research implementation projects and consumers can respond directly to those requests Since 2007 CUE has fostered over 75 partnerships between consumers and policymaking organizations including 12 in 2014 alone
 
To prepare all stakeholders for a panel with meaningful consumer engagement CUE has created a series of short videos based on reallife interactions between professionals and patients participating on advisory panels These videos demonstrate reallife scenarios and situations that professional guideline developers and consumer advocates serving on advisory panels are likely to encounter They focus on specific steps in the advisory panel process such as preparing for a panel as a consumer effectively moderating the panel as a Chair and how to ensure that diverse opinions are heard understood and respected during advisory panel meetings
