The contested judgment of taekwondo of 2010 Asian Games also called "Sockgate" is a dispute at the 2010 Asian Games on November 17 Taiwanese people
The judgment
Yang was facing Vietnamese opponent Vu Thi Hau in the first round of the flyweight division (under 49 kilogram) of the Asian Games taekwondo competition in Guangzhou Guangdong Peoples Republic of China
However with twelve seconds remaining in the first round of the bout when Yang was leading at an advantage of 9–0 Asian Taekwondo Union vicepresident Zhao Lei () of China instructed Filipino referee Fernandez S Estanislaoto to call Yang over to the side and inspected her heels Finding nothing the referee then called for the match referee to bring over the two sensors that had already been removed and kept under the chair that Yangs coach was sitting on Following that Zhao and the referee had a brief discussion and the match referee disqualified Yang and awarded Vu a 12–0 victory

The controversy
Chinese Taipei representatives at the taekwondo venue immediately pointed out that the equipment was certified and that both fighters passed a prematch inspection Following the disqualification Yang and her coach both protested on the mat for about an hour The World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) authorities then gave the ultimatum for them to leave or they would suspend every Chinese Taipei taekwondo member in the Game The WTF SecretaryGeneral Yang Jinsuk initially did not reveal the reason why Yang was disqualified and told the press that it was for the protection of the athletes personal privacy but later it was revealed the reason was for the sensors on her socks SecretaryGeneral later said "It was clearly a manipulative move with the intent of cheating and thats the reason why the individual was disqualified"

According to the SecretaryGeneral of the WTF there are two sorts of sensor socks for taekwondo It is specified that only the newer type is allowed to be used in the 2010 Asian Games because the older type of sensors are fixed by velcro which allows athletes to easily add new sensors themselves The sensors on the newer type are fixed by stitching and have no possibility to be altered by illegal methods but the newer type have no sensors on the heel

Yangs coach Liu Tsungda () said the inspector for the match asked Yang to change her socks due to poor signal response before the match Yang put on another set of older velcro socks and passed the equipment inspection During the match the sensors on the heel area had already been removed which should not affect the scoring record Right after the judgment Liu asked for the testimony of the inspector and the surveillance video as evidence but the demands were all rejected

The equipment supplier of the Chinese Taipei team said they had never received an official notification from the WTF about suspending the velcro type socks before the Asian Games There were many of the older type being used in other matches of different weight classes but those athletes didnt suffer any punishment before or after their matches According to the WTF official instruction for taekwondo athletes the former type is still legal in any international games until 2012 Summer Olympics
Political reaction
Political reaction in the Republic of China (Taiwan) came swiftly with politicians on both sides of the political spectrum rushing to Yangs defense The Kuomintang Legislative Yuan
The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Pan Menan () claimed at a press conference that the accusation by the Game officials that Yang had cheated was an "insult to everybody around the country" and charged that "the responsibility should fall on the people that conducted the equipment checks"

However not all was completely peaceful between the two political sides as the DPP leaders accused the government of a slow response The DPP Legislator Chiu Yiying () complained that: "A large number of officials attended the Games but all they have done so far is to show up at and take part in the awarding ceremonies when our athletes win When Yang was disqualified what did they do? Nothing"
