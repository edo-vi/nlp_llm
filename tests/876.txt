Image:Seatrout UDN saprolegniajpgUlcerative dermal necrosis  (UDN) is a  chronic dermatological disease of cold water salmonid fish that had a severe impact on north Atlantic Salmon and Brown trout
The onset of symptoms occurs after migration into freshwater Lesions become infected with overgrowths of oomycetes such as Saprolegnia giving the affected areas a slimy bluegrey appearance The most severely affected fish frequently die before spawn (biology)
Although the worst effects of the disease were seen in the 1970s and 1980 even now large numbers of salmon will succumb to the disease after spawning This is thought be due in part to their weak postspawning condition and lack of food for several months whilst in the river
