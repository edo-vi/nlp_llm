Chiropractic
Harvey is very critical of the way that complaints against chiropractors have been handled by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agencys (AHPRA) Chiropractic Board of Australia regarding violations of its registration standards since the boards inception The violations include "advertising in a misleading or deceptive manner" use of testimonials and encouragement of "unnecessary use of health services" After a lack of resolution to these complaints Harvey and the FSM approached the ACCC since they have "powers under national consumer law to prosecute for misleading and deceptive and unconscionable conduct" in the hopes that action would be taken to resolve the complaints

In 2015 over a year after contacting the ACCC Harvey and the FSM followed up on "ten representative complaints" to see if any action had been taken by either government body Of those complaints only one clinic resolved all of the issues while the others were still unresolved including one clinic which had simply set up a new website containing the previous violations It appeared that AHPRA had contacted the chiropractic clinics regarding the complaints but they had not done very much to enforce their own rules In response to this failure Harvey and his colleagues contacted the press including the AMJ and The Sydney Morning Herald bringing a large amount of attention to the issue
