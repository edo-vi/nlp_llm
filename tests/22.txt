In gridiron football and its variants American football and Canadian football the quarterback position is often considered the most important on the team While there have been a growing number of players of African or minority descent throughout the history of collegiate and professional football black players have historically faced difficulty in landing and retaining quarterback roles due to a number of factors In addition some black quarterbacks claim to have experienced bias towards or against them due to their race Black players as a whole are disproportionately over represented in the NFL being only ~13% of the US population yet 67% of NFL players are black with 17% of quarterbacks being black

 History 
Since the earliest days of professional and college football the number of black players let alone quarterbacks has been on the rise The first black quarterback to start professionally was Bernie Custis for the Hamilton TigerCats of the Canadian Football League in 1951 The first two in the United States were Marlin Briscoe and James Harris (quarterback)
The CFL was History of African Americans in the Canadian Football LeagueBlack quarterbacks</ref> Warren Moon also played in the CFL and won five Grey Cup championships in Canada before coming to play in the NFL Moons success largely broke the stereotype that blacks could not succeed as quarterbacks which ushered more prominent black quarterbacks into the NFL starting in the 1980s

In 1971 3% of quarterbacks in the NFL who threw at least 100 passes in the season were black but by 2001 this number had risen to 35% The 1999 NFL draft was notable as eight out of thirteen quarterbacks selected that year were black They include Donovan McNabb Akili Smith and Daunte Culpepper who were selected in the first round Michael Vick who was drafted two years later in 2001 NFL draft
In 2017 the New York Giants benched longtime quarterback Eli Manning in favor of Geno Smith who was declared the starter for one week The Giants were the last team never to field a black starting quarterback during an NFL season

File:1988 Redskins Police  16 Doug Williams (crop)jpgSince the inception of the game only three quarterbacks with known black ancestry have led their team to a Super Bowl victory: Doug Williams (quarterback)
Four quarterbacks with black ancestry (McNair Newton Mahomes and Lamar Jackson) have won the Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award 

In addition eight quarterbacks with known black ancestry have won the Heisman Trophy: Andre Ware in 1989 Charlie Ward in 1993 Troy Smith in 2006 Newton in 2010 Robert Griffin III in 2011 Jameis Winston in 2013 Jackson in 2016 and Kyler Murray who is multiracial in 2018

In Week 1 of the 2020 NFL season 10 quarterbacks with known black ancestry (Cam Newton Teddy Bridgewater Dwayne Haskins Lamar Jackson Patrick Mahomes Kyler Murray Dak Prescott Tyrod Taylor Deshaun Watson Russell Wilson) started games for their teams the most ever on opening week

 Stereotyping of black quarterbacks 

There is some controversy over how white and black quarterbacks tend to be described by the media especially with NFL draft prospects Draft experts and scouts have a history of describing black quarterbacks in ways that perpetuate racial stereotypes and hurt those prospects chances of making it to the NFL as a quarterback Even those who make it to the NFL allegedly continue to face this narrative

An empirical study published in The Howard Journal of Communications supported this hypothesis The researchers analyzed the written descriptions of quarterback prospects in the NFL Draft section of the Sports Illustrated website from 1998 to 2007 They looked at each players description for words or phrases about athleticism and intelligence and sorted them into categories based on whether they were positive or negative A significant difference was found between how black and white quarterbacks are described by SI Black quarterbacks tend to be praised for their athleticism and criticized for a lack of intelligence Meanwhile white quarterbacks are often praised for their intelligence and criticized for a lack of athleticism For example Daunte Culpepper and Tee Martin both black quarterbacks were described with terms such as "physical specimen" and "impressive specimen" respectively Meanwhile white players were described as "good signal callers" and "real students of the game"

Sports writers have discussed how Black quarterbacks often have their intellectual and leadership qualities as a quarterback minimized Due to "racial stacking" in sports in which players are typecast into certain onfield positions based on racial stereotypes Black players were rarely granted opportunities as quarterbacks as it was considered a "thinking" position

Wonderlic testing
Until 2022 players were given the Wonderlic Personnel Test a test of mental aptitude at the NFL Scouting Combine As of 2018 the average score of active Super Bowl winning quarterbacks was 307 which is particularly salient given the fact that a score of 22 is average and the position average is about 24 This list of winning quarterbacks included Russell Wilson who got a score of 28 Of all positions quarterbacks and offensive linemen particularly centers had the highest average scores as well as the greatest percentage of white players Tight end the position with the next highest position average also had a greater percentage of white players relative to the league average

There is evidence that higher Wonderlic scores are mildly correlated with lower interception rates and higher passer ratings However the Wonderlic test has not been without criticism with some claiming it is racially biased In addition some quarterbacks with low scores such as Donovan McNabb who is black and Jim Kelly who is white (15 for both) have had long successful careers in the NFL In 2013 the NFL began administering the Player Assessment Tool an additional test of mental aptitude to go alongside the Wonderlic during the combine process Following the 2021 season the League decided to eliminate the Wonderlic Test from the Combine process altogether

Notable examples of quarterbacks affected by racial stereotyping


 

 Marlin Briscoe 
After a successful college career as a quarterback the Denver Broncos drafted Marlin Briscoe in the 14th round of the 1968 NFL/AFL draft with plans to shift him to the defensive secondary It was commonplace back then to convert black players who had played quarterback to other positions but Briscoe did not sign with Denver until he was promised a chance to practice at quarterback After injuries to Denvers starter Briscoe became the first black quarterback to start a game in an American major professional football league in 1968 American Football League season
 James Harris 
James Harris (quarterback)
Kordell Stewart
After spending his first years in the NFL as a backup quarterback and utility player Kordell Stewart nicknamed "Slash" due to his versatility won the starting position for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1997 After a productive 1997 season at quarterback Stewart struggled after his offensive coordinator Chan Gailey left to become head coach of the Dallas Cowboys and at one point in 1998 was ordered by head coach Bill Cowher to attend wide receiver meetings instead of quarterback meetings though he would eventually return to the quarterback position in 1999 During this time rumors surfaced that Stewart had been arrested after being caught doing sexual acts with another man in Schenley Park leading to ongoing rumors of Stewarts sexuality to this day Stewart himself acknowledged that he believed the rumors were racebased and no such police report exists on Stewarts arrest confirming that the rumors were false

Stewart would face criticism for the rest of his time in Pittsburgh for his play race and rumored homosexuality even hearing a racial slur from a local fan despite a bounceback season in 2001 and as late as 2015 when encountering Steelers owner Dan Rooney at former teammate Jerome Bettiss induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame was told by Rooney that "he wouldve made a better wide receiver" He opened up about his experiences with Pittsburgh in a piece published by The Players Tribune Following the essays publication numerous journalists including Ron Cook of 
the Pittsburgh PostGazette expressed sympathy for Stewart and also confirmed witnessing the racism and homophobia displayed toward him during his tenure with the Steelers

 Donovan McNabb 
In 2003 conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh claimed that the media was biased in favor of Donovan McNabb a prominent black quarterback at the time Limbaugh stated that "the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well… he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he really didnt deserve" In a study of news coverage of white and black quarterbacks political scientist David Niven of Florida Atlantic University disputed Limbaughs claim and found that black quarterbacks including McNabb did not receive preferential treatment by the media yet neither did white quarterbacks noting there were "minor" and "inconsistent" differences

 Tyrod Taylor 
File:Tyrod Taylor against the TexansjpgIn a 2017 interview published by The Buffalo News thenBuffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor stated that he always knew he would be criticized more than his white counterparts a sentiment also echoed by Michael Vick and Cam Newton but that it drives him to be a better player

 Deshaun Watson 
Despite his ability to both pass and run effectively Cleveland Browns signalcaller Deshaun Watson prefers not to be called a dualthreat quarterback as he believes the term is often used to stereotype black quarterbacks In 2018 Watson then playing for the Houston Texans was the subject of racist remarks echoing these stereotypes after making a bad decision in a game The superintendent of the Onalaska school district outside of Houston Lynn Redden came under fire and later resigned for saying that “when you need precision decision making you cant count on a black quarterback"
