Mass vaccination is a public policy effort to vaccination
Under normal circumstances vaccines are provided as part of an individuals medical care starting from birth and given as part of routine checkups But there are times when there is a need to quickly vaccinate the population at large and provide easy access to the service When this occurs temporary clinics may be established around communities that can efficiently handle the many people within at once

Challenges of a mass vaccination effort include vaccine Supply (economics)
Historic mass vaccinations

 Smallpox 
 Early successes in eradication (prior to 1950) 
In 1947 after a man traveled from Mexico to New York City and developed smallpox Dr Israel Weinstein announced to the residents of New York the need to get vaccinated Vaccine clinics were established throughout the city and within less than a month 6350000 residents were vaccinated Because smallpox vaccination requires a live virus it originally required a sample to be transferred from persontoperson or animaltoperson directly This method involved the use of glycerol as a preservative and was significant for storage and transportation In addition to these benefits it enabled mass production through the use of animals and ensured long term viability at temperatures below freezing However this method was not sufficient enough to enable widespread vaccination in tropical regions of the world and thus was largely restricted to temperate countries Compulsory vaccinations were used throughout the beginning of the 20th century in a most of these countries which led to the decline of smallpox For countries such as the United States Canada the United Kingdom and some other European countries outbreaks were quickly shut down by strong public health policies Soon the more deadly Variola Major smallpox variant steadily declined and endemics were only brought on by travelers from countries that lacked control over smallpox outbreaks Its important to note that the  milder Variola Minor smallpox variant remained prevalent until the mid20th century as it often didnt warrant hospital visits or was misdiagnosed The success of health policies in controlling and eliminating smallpox by 1950s in many countries led some to believe that the world eradication of smallpox would be possible

 Interest in worldwide eradication (19501959) 
The creation of a heat stable freezedried vaccine occurred in the 1950s Further improvements in freezedrying technology allowed for the mass production of the vaccine at a commercial level The Health Assembly a group within the World Health Organization
 Smallpox eradication program (19601966) 
The eradication of smallpox seemed to be easier and less costly than other previously eradicated diseases This was particularly a problem in developing countries The WHO was not designed to provide considerable material support and close collaboration between countries on a wide scale Over the first few years of the programs initiation a lack of donations of vaccines and money hindered the success of the program The WHO created the Expert Committee on Smallpox in 1964 due to the lack of progress A report was released giving a more clear strategy to be implemented in the form of different phases Based on outbreaks that occurred in India in regions that claimed to have more than 80% vaccination rates the committee determined that 100% of the population would need to be vaccinated in the first mass vaccination phase After this they would focus on stopping subsequent cases and investigating them This was not well received during the Seventeenth World Health Assembly in which many express doubts over the success especially with extreme vaccine shortages following a lack of donations It wasnt until 1965 that the USA increased commitment to the cause yet not out of interest but because they were already starting a measles eradication campaign and felt this could be added on This along with continued support from the USSR led the WHO to develop an intensified program for smallpox eradication however many members still lacked confidence in this new programs success

 Intensified smallpox eradication program (19671980) 
From 1967 the Intensified Smallpox Program now called for surveillance reporting and investigation in addition to mass vaccination In the years following the initiation of this plan the WHO saw an increase in qualified volunteers contributions from countries and participation in their campaign It would not be until May 8 1980 during the World Health Assembly that smallpox was announced as officially eradicated

 Criticism of mass vaccination 
Vaccination policies were not met without resistance as countries that had mandatory vaccination policies saw a rise in antivaccination movements In Brazil compulsory vaccination was met with riots The lack of control led to large outbreaks and many deaths Other countries had more success in vaccination which led to Variola Minor replacing Variola Major as the cause of smallpox outbreaks in these countries Antivaccinationists rejected vaccination policy more as this more mild form was not seen as significant This was particularly an issue in the United States as only some states had compulsory vaccination while others banned or lacked laws for it

Polio
File:Oral Polio VaccinejpgPoliomyelitis is a disease which causes lower body paralysis through the damage of motor neurons caused by three strains of the poliovirus Only 1% of polio cases actually result in paralysis In 1916 the United States experienced a polio epidemic which paralyzed over 27000 people and lead to 6000 deaths These outbreaks gradually became worse and worse as it spread throughout the Americas and to Europe Jonas Salk developed the first inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in 1953 which was tested in a clinical trial that enrolled 16 million children in Canada Finland and the United States With the distribution of Salks vaccine cases decreased from 139 to 08 cases per 100000 in a period of only 7 years from 1954 to 1961 By 1956 Albert Sabin had created the liveattenuated vaccine also known as the oral polio vaccine (OPV) which contained three types of wild polio strains After almost two decades in 1972 Sabin decided to donate his vaccine strains to the World Health Organization
In the years following the development of the vaccines from 1977 to 1995 children who had been fully vaccinated with all three doses of OPV had risen from 5% to 80% This effort was titled the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and has seen wild success with a decrease in 99% of cases worldwide by 2018 When the global campaign began in 1988 there were over 125 polioendemic countries compared to only 20 by the year 2000 Wealthier countries with better infrastructure were able to use more resources and introduce better health strategies to achieve herd immunity early on The WHO Region of the Americas declared themselves to be polio free in 1994 Following this enormous achievement other WHO regions quickly followed with the Western Pacific Region declared polio free in 2000 the European Region in 2002 and SouthEast Asia Region in 2014

Mass vaccination strategies such as National Immunization Days were key to the success of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) In South America transmission rates severely declined in the mid1980s following the invention and widespread use of the OPV With such an incredibly high amount of vaccinations within a short time frame the overall incidence of Polio was decreased Other countries such as India were able to vaccinate over 120 million children in large scale vaccination days which became a regular occurrence

 Polio campaigns in America 
Several famous Americans helped pave the way for the acceptance of the polio vaccine in the United States Franklin D Roosevelt one of the most famous polio patients in the world created the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis in 1938 which eventually became known as March of Dimes The March of Dimes funded a large portion of the polio research all throughout the epidemic and eventually resulted in the development of the vaccine by Jonas Salk This act embodied three of the most important pillars of a behavioral change campaign: social influence social norms and examples Elvis Presley used his social influence to normalize getting the polio vaccine which increased vaccination rates among American youth to over 80% in just under 6 months These types campaigns were the heart of the mass vaccination efforts in America

 Barriers to eradication 
Despite the global efforts to vaccinate and eradicate polio the virus still causes outbreaks every year As of 2021 only wild polio virus type 1(WPV1)  affects the world and are localized in Afghanistan and Pakistan While both the live and inactivated polio vaccines were wildly successful in saving the world from the historic endemic there still are drawbacks with each of the vaccines The OPV vaccine was reverted to an infectious strain which led to the rise of the cVDPV While the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) protected the host it was not strong enough to generate intestinal mucosa immunity and therefore did not prevent the transmission of the virus These weaknesses suggest that more innovative vaccines or a combination of the two is needed to completely eradicate polio

Swine flu vaccination
In 1918 the deadly Influenza A virus subtype H1N1
For the first mass immunization campaign in 1947 the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
Swine flu also known as Influenza A virus subtype H1N1
A worldwide study was conducted which comprehensively analyzed adamantanes resistance in Influenza A virus subtype H1N1
Contemporary usage
COVID19
The introduction of multiple COVID19 vaccines throughout the pandemic such as Pfizerâ€“BioNTech COVID19 vaccine
When COVID19 was identified in December 2019 there were no vaccines readily available to vaccinate mass populations
File:COVID19 vaccines (2021) DjpgThe type of vaccines that are available are messenger RNA vector and protein subunit messenger RNA vaccines work by giving cells specific instructions to make the S protein found on the surface of the COVID19 virus

When vaccinating large populations an action plan must be created to organize which groups will receive the vaccination firstFile:Salisbury Mass Vaccination Site  51053268081jpg
As well as mass vaccination centers being established at many locations such as stadiums led to many people getting vaccinated

In the United States NFL commissioner Roger Goodell offered the leagues 30 stadiums as mass vaccination sites As of April 2021 NFL stadiums have administered more than 2 million doses By December 2021 more than 100000 people had received vaccinations at Indianapolis Motor Speedway

Pharmacist have also played an important role in getting mass populations vaccinated since they are a skilled and trained workforce able to help increase vaccination rates Many people can turn to drug or convivence stores to get vaccinated since it can be a quick and easy place to access Without the involvement of pharmacies mass vaccination would be difficult to achieve in most communities 90% of people live within five miles of a pharmacy Pharmacist can oftentimes be the quickest access to a healthcare provider making it a desirable option for the public to come and get vaccinated

Not only have pharmacist been involved in COVID19 vaccinations but pharmacy technicians as well Pharmacy technicians can support pharmacist which will allow more vaccination services to be accommodated efficiently and safety These efforts will allow for an increase in vaccinations and help vaccinate large groups at a time

During the pandemic pharmacist have had a fundamental roll in sharing information about COVID19 vaccines They are also advocates for getting vaccinated since they are educators and vaccine administrators Sharing information to the public about COVID19 vaccines can help increase vaccinations rates Since pharmacist are easily accessible in the community setting they can help motivate or encourage getting vaccinated helping decrease preventable infections or diseases such as COVID19

Mass vaccination of COVID19 vaccines is important to help stop the spread of the coronavirus and eventually end the pandemic Countries such as the United States Canada and Australia were able to receive many vaccines early on due to them being wealthier countries They were able to receive many doses enough to vaccinate their own countries but this left other lowerincome countries with limited supply of the vaccines With some countries receiving more vaccines than others this leads to inequitable distribution and can increase the risk of new outbreaks Without proper global vaccine distribution it will make it more difficult to end the pandemic and allow for mass vaccination as a global effort Amid the new strains of the coronavirus such as the SARSCoV2 Omicron variant
