Dying is the final stage of life which will eventually lead to death. Diagnosing dying is a complex process of clinical decision-making and most practice checklists facilitating this diagnosis are based on cancer diagnoses.



 Signs of dying 

The National Cancer Institute in the United States advises that the presence of some of the following signs may indicate that death is approaching:

* Drowsiness increased sleep and/or unresponsiveness (caused by changes in the patients metabolism).
* Confusion about time place and/or identity of loved ones; restlessness; visions of people and places that are not present; pulling at bed linens or clothing (caused in part by changes in the patients metabolism).
* Decreased socialization and withdrawal (caused by decreased oxygen to the brain decreased blood flow and mental preparation for dying).
* Decreased need for food and fluids and loss of appetite (caused by the bodys need to conserve energy and its decreasing ability to use food and fluids properly).
* Loss of bladder or bowel control (caused by the relaxing of muscles in the pelvic area).
* Darkened urine or decreased amount of urine (caused by slowing of kidney function and/or decreased fluid intake).
* Skin becoming cool to the touch particularly the hands and feet; skin may become bluish in color especially on the underside of the body (caused by decreased circulation to the extremities).
* Rattling or gurgling sounds while breathing which may be loud (death rattle); breathing that is irregular and shallow; decreased number of breaths per minute; breathing that alternates between rapid and slow (caused by congestion from decreased fluid consumption a buildup of waste products in the body and/or a decrease in circulation to the organs).
* Turning of the head toward a light source (caused by decreasing vision).
* Increased difficulty controlling pain (caused by progression of the disease).
* Involuntary movements (called myoclonus) increased heart rate hypertension followed by hypotension and loss of reflexes in the legs and arms are additional signs that the end of life is near.

 Cultural perspectives on dying 
How humans understand and approach the process dying differs across cultures. In some cultures death is the complete termination of life. In other cultures death can include altered states of being like sleep or illness. In some traditions death marks the transition into a different kind of existence or involves a cyclic pattern of death and rebirth. These cultural differences affect peoples lifestyles behaviors and approach to death and dying.

 United States 
In the United States a pervasive "death-defying" culture leads to resistance against the process of dying. As the United States is a culturally diverse nation attitudes towards death and dying vary according to cultural and spiritual factors.

 China 
In China
 South Pacific 
In some cultures of the South Pacific life is believed to leave a persons body when they are sick or asleep making for multiple "deaths" in the span of one lifetime.

 Religious perspectives on dying 

 Christianity 
In Christianity
 Islam 

In Islamic belief the time of death is predetermined with dying therefore perceived as the will of Allah. Dying is therefore considered as something to be accepted with Muslims regularly encouraged to reflect upon death and dying. The majority of Muslims prefer to die at home surrounded by their loved ones with large numbers expected at the bedside of those who are dying.

 Hinduism 
In Hinduism people are believed to die and be reborn with a new identity.

 Buddhism 
In Chinese Buddhism it is said that dying patients will experience phases between the state of torment and the state of exultation and that caretaker must help the dying patient remain in the state of exultation through Nianfo prayers. In some parts of Buddhism the dead and living exist together with the former having power and influence over the lives of the latter.

 Medicalization 

 Resuscitation 
Resuscitation is the act of reviving of someone and is performed when someone is unconscious or dying. Resuscitation is performed using a variety of techniques of those the most common is Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
 End-of-life care 
End-of-life care is oriented towards a natural stage in the process of living unlike other conditions. The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) states that hospice care or end-of-life care begins when curative treatments are no longer possible and a person is diagnosed with a terminal illness with less than six months to live. Hospice care involves palliative care aimed at providing at comfort for patients and support for loved ones. This process integrates medical care pain management as well as social and emotional support provided by social workers and other members of the healthcare team including family physicians nurses counselors trained volunteers and home health aides. Hospice care is associated with enhanced symptom relief facilitates achievement of end-of-life wishes and results in higher quality of end-of-life care compared with standard care involving extensive hospitalization.

 Psychological adjustment processes 
When a person realizes that their life is threatened by a fatal illness they come to terms with it and with their approaching end. This confrontation has been described in diaries autobiographies medical reports novels and also in poetry. Since the middle of the 20th century the "fight" against death has been researched in the social sciences on the basis of Empirical research
The theories of dying describe psychosocial aspects of dying as well as models for the dying process. Particularly highlighted psychosocial aspects are: Cicely Saunders
Phase and stage models
There have been many phase and stage models for the course of dying developed from a psychological and psychosocial perspective. A distinction is made between three and twelve phases that a dying person goes through.

A more recently developed and revised phase model is the Illness Constellation Model first published in 1991. The phases are associated with shock dizziness and uncertainty at the first symptoms and diagnosis; changing emotional states and thoughts efforts to maintain control over ones own life; withdrawal grief over lost abilities and suffering from the imminent loss of ones own existence; finally psycho-physical decline.

The best known is the Five stages of griefFrom Kübler-Rosss research psychiatrists have set new impulses for dealing with dying and grieving people. Her key message was that the people aiding must first clarify their own fears and life problems ("unfinished business") as far as possible and accept their own death before they can turn to the dying in a helpful way. 
The five phases of dying were extracted by Kübler-Ross from interviews of terminally ill people describing psychological adjustment processes in the dying process. The five phases are widely referred to although Kübler-Ross herself critically questions the Validity (statistics)
In international research on dying there are a number of scientifically based objections to the phase model and to models that describe dying in terms of staged behaviors in general. Above all the naïve use of the phase model is viewed critically and even in specialist books hope–a central aspect of the phase model for Kübler-Ross–is not mentioned.

Influencing factors
The scientifically based criticism of phase models has led to forgoing defying the dying process in stages and instead to elaborating on factors that influence the course of dying. 
Based on research findings from several sciences Robert J. Kastenbaum says "Individuality and universality combine in dying."
In Kastenbaums model individual and societal attitudes influence our dying and how we deal with knowledge about dying and death. Influencing factors are age gender interpersonal relationships the type of illness the environment in which treatment takes place religion and culture. This model is the personal reality of the dying person where fear refusal and acceptance form the core of the dying persons confrontation with death.

Ernst Engelke took up Kastenbaums approach and developed it further with the thesis "Just as each persons life is unique so is their death unique. Nevertheless there are similarities in the death of all people. According to this all terminally ill people have in common that they are confronted with realizations responsibilities and constraints that are typical of dying." For example a characteristic realization is that the illness is threatening their life. Typical constraints result from the disease therapies and side effects. In Engelkes model the personal and unique aspects of death result from the interaction of many factors in coping with the realizations responsibilities and constraints. Important factors include the following: the genetic make-up personality life experience physical psychological social financial religious and spiritual resources; the type degree and duration of the disease the consequences and side effects of treatment the quality of medical treatment and care the material surroundings (i.e. furnishings of the apartment clinic home); and the expectations norms and behavior of relatives carers doctors and the public. According to Engelke the complexity of dying and the uniqueness of each dying person creates guidelines for communication with dying people.

 Awareness 
Along with medical professionals and relatives sociologists and psychologists also engage in the question of whether it is Ethics
The Hospice Movement in the United Kingdom in particular has since advocated for open Trust (social science)
