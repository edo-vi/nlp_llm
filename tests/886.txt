 Formation mechanisms 
A surface nepheloid layer (SNL) may be created due to particle flotation while intermediate nepheloid layers (INL) may be formed at the slopes of the ocean bed due to the dynamics of internal waves These intermediate nepheloid layers are derived from bottom nepheloid layers (BNL) after the layers become detached and spread along isopycnal surfaces

Open ocean convection has a prominent effect on the distribution of nepheloid layers and their ability to form in certain areas of the ocean such as the northern Atlantic Ocean and the northwestern Mediterranean Sea Nepheloid layers are more likely to form based on patterns of deep ocean circulation that directly affect the abyssal plain This is largely through the disruption of accumulated sediments in areas that deep ocean currents interact with Convection currents that disturb areas of the ocean floor such as those that circulate via ocean gyres also affect the concentration and relative sizes of the suspended sediments and by extension the areas corresponding Biotic component
 Impacts 

 Bathymetry 
The existence of the nepheloid layer complicates Bathymetry
 Marine life 
Depending on the characteristics of a particular nepheloid layer they can have a significant impact on marine life in the area The layers of sediments can block natural light making it difficult for Photosynthesis
 Examples 

Gulf of Mexico
A prominent nepheloid layer exists in the Gulf of Mexico extending from the delta of the Brazos River to South Padre Island Many species of polychaete worms Amphipod
 Porcupine Bank 
A prominent nepheloid layer exists in the Porcupine Bank Geographically the nepheloid layers are more detectable and prominent along the Porcupine Banks western slope Both the bottom and intermediate nepheloid layers form due to a myriad of factors such as Internal tide<br />
