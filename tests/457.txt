In his autobiography Tony Bennett claims to have created "the first music video" when he was filmed walking along the Serpentine (lake)
The oldest example of a promotional music video with similarities to more abstract modern videos seems to be the Czechoslovakia "Dáme si do bytu" ("Lets get to the apartment") created and directed by Ladislav Rychman

 Beginnings of popular music television and promotional clips: 1960–1973 
In the late 1950s the Scopitone a visual jukebox was introduced in France and short films were produced by many French artists such as Serge Gainsbourg Françoise Hardy Jacques Dutronc and the Belgian Jacques Brel to accompany their songs Its use spread to other countries and similar machines such as the Cinebox in Italy and Colorsonic in the US were patented In 1964 Kenneth Angers experimental film
On January 1 1964 Johnnie Stewart and Stanley Dorfman created the British Record chart
In 1964 The Moody Blues producer Alex Wharton
Also in 1964 the Beatles starred in their first feature film A Hard Days Night (film)
In 1965 the Beatles began making promotional clips (then known as "filmed inserts") for distribution and broadcast on Top of the Pops and in different countries—primarily the United StatesFile:TrailerUSHelpjpg
Concert films were being released in the mid1960s at least as early as 1964 with the TAMI Show

The monochrome 1965 clip for Bob Dylans "Subterranean Homesick Blues" filmed by D A Pennebaker was featured in Pennebakers Dylan film documentary Dont Look Back Eschewing any attempt to simulate performance or present a narrative the clip shows Dylan standing in a city back alley silently shuffling a series of large cue cards (bearing key words from the songs lyrics)

Besides the Beatles many other UK artists made "filmed inserts" so they could be screened on TV when the bands were not available to appear live The Who featured in several promotional clips beginning with their 1965 clip for "I Cant Explain" Their plot clip for "Happy Jack (song)
The Rolling Stones appeared in many promotional clips for their songs in the 1960s In 1966 Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)

During late 1972–73 Alice Cooper featured in a series of promotional films: "Elected (song)
Country music also picked up on the trend of promotional film clips to publicize songs Sam Lovullo the producer of the television series Hee Haw explained his show presented "what were in reality the first musical videos" while JMI Records made the same claim with Don Williams 1973 song "The Shelter of Your Eyes" Country music historian Bob Millard wrote that JMI had pioneered the country music video concept by "producing a 3minute film" to go along with Williams song Lovullo said his videos were conceptualized by having the shows staff go to nearby rural areas and film animals and farmers before editing the footage to fit the storyline of a particular song "The video material was a very workable production item for the show" he wrote "It provided picture stories for songs However some of our guests felt the videos took attention away from their live performances which they hoped would promote record sales If they had a hit song they didnt want to play it under comic barnyard footage" The concepts mixed reaction eventually spelled an end to the "video" concept on Hee Haw Promotional films of country music songs however continued to be produced

At the end of the 1970s the broadcasting of music videos on television became more and more regular in several countries The music videos were for example broadcast in weekly music programs or inserted into various programs In the United States for example on terrestrial networks at the end of the 1970s music videos were sometimes broadcast on music shows: The Midnight Special Don Kirshners Rock Concert and occasionally on certain talk shows

A worldwide pioneer in programs that only transmitted rock and pop music video clips was the Peruvian program Disco Club hosted by the Peruvian musician Gerardo ManuelFreetoair Tv) in June 1978 3 years before the appearance of MTV Initially it was only broadcast on Saturdays at 7 pm  but due to acceptance in November of that same year it began to be broadcast every day

Two key innovations in the development of the modern music video were the development of relatively inexpensive and easytouse video recording and editing equipment and the development of visual effects created with techniques such as image compositing The advent of highquality color videotape recorders and portable video cameras coincided with the DIY ethos of the New wave musicDuring the 1980s music videos had become de rigueur for most recording artists The phenomenon was famously parodied by BBC television comedy program Not The Nine OClock News who produced a spoof music video "Nice Video Shame About The Song" (the title was a spoof of a recent pop hit "Nice Legs Shame About Her Face")

In this period directors and the acts they worked with began to discover and expand the form and style of the genre using more sophisticated effects in their videos mixing film and video and adding a storyline or plot to the music video Occasionally videos were made in a nonrepresentational form in which the musical artist was not shown Because music videos are mainly intended to promote the artist such videos are comparatively rare; three early 1980s examples are Bruce Springsteens "Atlantic City (song)

Official lofi Internet music clips
Following the shift toward internet broadcasting and the rising popularity of usergenerated video sites such as YouTube around 2006 various independent filmmakers began films recording live sessions to present on the Web Examples of this new way of creating and presenting a music video include Vincent Moons work with The TakeAway Shows; In the Van sessions a similar platform; and the Dutch VPRO 3VOOR12 which puts out music videos recorded in elevators and other small guerrilla filmmaking type locations in a similar tradition called Behind All of these swiftly recorded clips are made with minimal budgets and share similar aesthetics with the lofi music movement of the early nineties Offering freedom from the increasingly burdensome financial requirements of highproduction movielike clips it began as the only method for littleknown indie music artists to present themselves to a wider audience but increasingly this approach has been taken up by such major mainstream artists as REM and Tom Jones (singer)

The music video for REMs 1986 song "Fall on Me (REM song)
Lyric videos rose to greater prominence in the 2010s when it became relatively easy for artists to disperse videos through websites such as YouTube Many do not feature any visual related to the musician in question but merely a background with the lyrics appearing over it as they are sung in the song The concept album video featured imagery pulsing to the music and stylized typography created by bandleader Simlev The 2016 song "Closer (Chainsmokers song)Lyric video
