The 2018 United States adenovirus outbreak was an occurrence in which an unusual number of adenovirus cases were reported at two locations one in Maryland and one in New Jersey from September to December 2018 resulting in deaths in both states At least 35 people contracted the disease in each location of the outbreak In New Jersey the ill ranged in age from toddlers to adults and eleven children died It was "one of the nations deadliest longtermcare outbreaks" and "one of the nations worst recorded outbreaks of the adenovirus" The adenovirus outbreak led to the passage of new legislation in 2019 concerning the containment of outbreaks in longterm care centers in New Jersey

History
Sept 2018: New Jersey outbreak
In September 2018 an adenovirus outbreak began at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation a care facility for those with shortterm rehab or longterm needs in Wanaque New Jersey on September 26 2018 when a child developed symptoms of a respiratory ailment in the pediatric ventilator unit followed by a second child misdiagnosed as having respiratory ailments and that day as well the NJ health department was notified of a "cluster of respiratory illnesses"

The commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health was notified about the outbreak on October 19 when five children had died The state sent inspectors on October 21 in a surprise inspection concluding that the center had yet to "establish and maintain an infection prevention and control program"  Medicare (United States)
On October 24 2018 a government inspection report cited Wanaque for several deficiencies from 2015 to 2018 Elnahal head of the state health department asserted the issues had been corrected and that the state would permanently surveil the facility

Reported on November 9 2018 two anonymous employees spoke to NJ Advance Media and claimed that "senior administrators delayed sending kids to the hospital" to keep the pediatric unit as full as possible maximizing funds amounting to $51946 from Medicaid per patient per day After the report the state health commissioner sent inspectors to the facility After November 12 2018 the outbreak was reported under control

NovDec 2018: Wanaque aftermath

On November 14 the center was ordered by the state to isolate sick patients

From October to November 2018 the virus infected 35 people at the Wanaque Center including 23 children  Ultimately 36 residents and one staff member were diagnosed with the adenovirus The ill ranged in age from toddlers to teens and eleven children died It was "one of the nations deadliest longtermcare outbreaks" and "one of the nations worst recorded outbreaks of the adenovirus"

Over three visits in early November state inspectors gave the Wanaque Center the worst rating possible "immediate jeopardy" blamed the outbreak on the centers response particularly management for lack of planning and slow responses leading to delays "in identifying reporting and controlling the outbreak"

NovDec 2018: University of Maryland outbreak
At the height of the outbreak in New Jersey an outbreak of the same strain of the virus occurred among students at the University of Maryland College Park The college learned about the first case of adenovirus on November 1 It has been proposed that the Maryland outbreak was connected to a Mold (fungus)
In January 2019 the University of Maryland began a weekslong effort to have a contracted cleaning company disinfect all surfaces in the dorms where the outbreak occurred The death of Paregol prompted Maryland Governor Larry Hogan to address the matter as "very concerning"

20182019: New Jersey responses
On November 20 2018 members of the New Jersey Legislature representing the affected district sent a letter to New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal requesting an investigation of claims that "the facility delayed sending children for treatment for nonmedical reasons" relating to the collection of Medicaid payments

A hearing on the outbreak was held by the NJ Senate Health Committee At the hearing the NJ health department head announced that state health policy had been changed as a result of the outbreak requiring the health commissioner to be notified immediately when outbreaks result in the deaths of children

In direct response to the Wanaque outbreak a June 2019 report from the New Jersey Health Department called for new legislation that would require New Jerseys longterm care centers to submit outbreak response plans to the state The issue was included through $25 million in competitive grant funding by the proposed budget of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy The resultant state bill A5527 was based on the report and faced no opposition when passing both houses of the state legislature in late June 2019 On August 15 2019 Murphy cited the 11 dead children of the Wanaque Center outbreak when signing the bill into law Among other regulations A5527 requires certain longterm facilities to provide outbreak response plans to the state within 180 days of signing Other new requirements involve promptly notifying residents families staff and visitors of an outbreak
