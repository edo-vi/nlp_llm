A biologist is a scientist who conducts research in biology. Biologists are interested in studying life on Earth whether it is an individual Cell (biology)
Biologists who are involved in basic research have the aim of advancing knowledge about the natural world. Their discoveries may have Applied scienceApplied research
In modern times most biologists have one or more academic degrees such as a bachelors degree plus an advanced degree like a masters degree or a doctorate. Like other scientists biologists can be found working in different sectors of the economy such as in academy 
History
File:Barbara McClintock (1902-1992) shown in her laboratory in 1947.jpgFrancesco Redi the founder of biology is recognized to be one of the greatest biologists of all time. Robert Hooke an English natural philosopher coined the term cell (biology)
Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace
In 1953 James D. Watson and Francis Crick described the basic structure of DNA the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms building on the work of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix.

Ian Wilmut led a research group that in 1996 first cloned a mammal from an adult somatic cell a Finnish Dorset lamb named Dolly.

Education
An Undergraduate education
Students who aspire to a research-oriented career usually pursue a graduate degree such as a masterâ€™s or a doctorate (e.g. PhD) whereby they would receive training from a research head based on an apprenticeship model that has been in existence since the 1800s. Students in these graduate programs often receive specialized training in a particular subdiscipline of biology.

Research

Biologists typically conduct laboratory experiments involving animals plants microorganisms or biomolecules. However a small part of biological research also occurs outside the laboratory and may involve natural observation rather than experimentation. For example a botanist may investigate the plant species present in a particular environment while an ecologist might study how a forest area recovers after a fire.

Biologists who work in applied research use instead the accomplishments gained by basic research to further knowledge in particular fields or applications. For example this applied research may be used to develop new pharmaceutical drugs treatments and medical diagnostic tests. Biological scientists conducting applied research and product development in private industry may be required to describe their research plans or results to non-scientists who are in a position to veto or approve their ideas. These scientists must consider the business effects of their work.

Swift advances in knowledge of genetics and organic molecules spurred growth in the field of biotechnology transforming the industries in which biological scientists work. Biological scientists can now manipulate the genetic material of animals and plants attempting to make organisms (including humans) more productive or resistant to disease. Basic and applied research on biotechnological processes such as recombining DNA has led to the production of important substances including human insulin and growth hormone. Many other substances not previously available in large quantities are now produced by biotechnological means. Some of these substances are useful in treating diseases.

Those working on various genome (chromosomes with their associated genes) projects isolate genes and determine their function. This work continues to lead to the discovery of genes associated with specific diseases and inherited health risks such as sickle cell anemia. Advances in biotechnology have created research opportunities in almost all areas of biology with commercial applications in areas such as medicine agriculture and environmental remediation.

Specializations
Most biological scientists specialize in the study of a certain type of organism or in a specific activity although recent advances have blurred some traditional classifications.
* Geneticists study genetics the science of genes heredity and Genetic variation* Neuroscientists study the nervous system.
* Developmental biology* Biochemists study the chemical composition of living things. They analyze the complex chemical combinations and reactions involved in metabolism reproduction and growth.
* Molecular biology* Microbiologists investigate the growth and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria algae or Fungus* Physiology* Biophysics* Computational biology* Zoology* Botany* Aquatic biologists study micro-organisms plants and animals living in water. Marine Biology* Ecology* Evolutionary biology
Employment
Biologists typically work regular hours but longer hours are not uncommon. Researchers may be required to work odd hours in laboratories or other locations (especially while in the field) depending on the nature of their research.

Many biologists depend on Grant (money)
Marine biologists encounter a variety of working conditions. Some work in laboratories; others work on research ships and those who work underwater must practice safe diving while working around sharp coral reefs and hazardous marine life. Although some marine biologists obtain their specimens from the sea many still spend a good deal of their time in laboratories and offices conducting tests running experiments recording results and compiling data.

Biologists are not usually exposed to unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Those who work with dangerous organisms or Toxicity
Honors and awards
The highest honor awarded to biologists is the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded since 1901 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Another significant award is the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences; established in 1980.
