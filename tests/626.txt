Synopsis
The video begins with shots of a vacant village overgrown with weeds and the concrete sarcophagus of a coveredover nuclear reactor in the background As the music begins the scene changes to a Science fiction
The scene changes again now to bright daylight and blue sky Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta (750/101)
The scene changes back to the discovery of the girl in the tower and the identity of the two policemen is revealed to be the same from the previous sequence They carefully carry her out and offer her something to drink A team of scientists wearing Hazmat suit
The two men are haunted by the girls fate and formulate a plan to rescue her They break into the laboratory and free her from confinement but the labs alarms are triggered The three escape in an Armored car (valuables)
A brief montage of previous shots follows: the discovery of the girl the girl flying through a blue sky the two men rescuing the girl from the laboratory and stealing the truck the truck plummeting amidst the wreckage of the roadway But this time the truck fires stabilizing thrusters and makes a short flight into the side of an apartment building After their escape the three are riding an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto through a dark tunnel underneath signs which bear radiation symbols and read (in kanji) "Beware Of Sunlight" and "Survival Not Guaranteed" As they emerge into daylight they drive past nuclear cooling towers and a sign which reads "Extreme Danger" and continue down the road

One of the men helps the girl up she spreads her wings and gives them a grateful smile; he kisses her hand and the other winks in farewell Soon she is drifting upward into the sky Briefly a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees The car veers off the road and slows to a stop in the grass

Production
The production of the music video began because Miyazaki was suffering from writers block on Princess Mononoke and needed another project to distract him Miyazaki wrote and directed the music video for "On Your Mark" although the song was previously released in 1994 as part of the single "Heart" Despite the popularity of the work Toshio Suzuki (producer)
In the production of the music video Miyazaki experimented with using computer animation to supplement Traditional animation
Analysis
The deliberately nonlinear enigmatic and cryptic style of the music video was intended to stimulate the imaginations of its viewers and their interpretations of the music video" Miyazaki offered an interpretation of the angel as "Hope" and to protect hope could paradoxically mean "to let it go where noone can touch it"

Cavallaro noted that the lyrics of the song include "ryuukou no kaze" which translates to "flu" and is also an idiom for "the flu of fashion" The author further interpreted it as "I always feel the urge to make a fresh start" suggesting this could be the "bleak acceptance of the ideological and economic codes that mold our lives in accordance with the imperative of planned obsolescence or as a hopeful embracing of the genuine prospects of renewal and change" Cavallaro suggested that despite the feminine appearance of the "angel" it could be of a "preternatural order" making gender or sex distinctions irrelevant Miyazaki referred to the angelic creature as "tori no hito" or "a birds person" which is the nickname of Nausicaä (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind)
During their April 1999 lecture series on manga anime and the works of Miyazaki at the University of Dallas Pamela Gossin Professor of Arts and Humanities and guest instructor Marc Hairston research scientist in the William B Hanson Center for Space Sciences discussed On Your Mark in their lecture "In the Coda On Your Mark and Nausicaa and drew parallels to the Nausicaä story its titular character and its conclusion Gossin and Hairston interpreted the release of the winged girl at the end of the video as Miyazaki setting free his character in a manner reminiscent of William Shakespeares symbolic liberation of his characters through Prosperos release of his servant Ariel (The Tempest)The final volume of the Nausicaä manga was released in January 1995 Miyazaki started creating On Your Mark that same month

McCarthy highlighted similarities to different works and real life found throughout the film remarking that the opening city sequence could be an homage to Akira (1988 film)
Miyazaki scholar  observed that the urban settings have a China Town style and resemble the cityscapes of Mamoru Oshiis Ghost in the Shell animated film adaptation in production at the time While Miyazaki has been noncommittal about the nature of his winged entity in On your Mark Kanō noted that the manga Seraphim 266613336Wings an unfinished collaborative effort by Oshii and Satoshi Kon with its Angel Disease theme was still serialized in Animage at the time Miyazaki was creating On Your Mark in 1995
