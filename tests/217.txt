Polio (Infantile paralysis or poliomyelitis) epidemics were a concern during the summer months for children globally with records of polio from the Egyptians and Greeks to the 1950s epidemics Two US virologists Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh and Albert B Sabin of the University of Cincinnati emerged as the most prominent among dozens of American researchers on the quest for a polio vaccine

Salks vaccine
By 1950 Jonas Salk had tested both live attenuated polio vaccines and formaldehydekilled polio vaccines in monkeys and by 1952 began testing on humans The killed vaccine with proper filtration of the biological culture was found to be effective A problem with this vaccine was the perception that to be adequately protected; a child needed three properly spaced injections and a recommended booster shot every year which was expensive However Jonas Salk stated in interviews that this perception was not true The Salk vaccine was the first polio vaccine to receive approval of the US government and was used in the United States until 1961 when the Sabin vaccine was recommended to replace it

Sabins vaccine
Albert Sabin a virologist who publicly disagreed with Salk and his killed vaccine worked on creating a vaccine with live attenuated vaccines With the clearance of the FBI Sabin flew to Leningrad in June 1956

Cold war tensions

Cold War tensions caused Western scientists to discount reports from the Russians about the effectiveness of the Sabin vaccine However mass vaccinations of Sabins vaccine spread throughout Eastern Europe from 1960 to 1963 Just as some Soviet virologists did not trust the American Salk vaccine Americans had similar reservations about the Sabin vaccine However other Soviet virologists argued that the Salk vaccine could be considered safe because the Americans had tested it on their own people and that the Sabin vaccine must be potentially dangerous because the Americans did not want to test it on their own society

Federal licensing
The documented achievement of the Sabin–Chumakov collaboration eventually overcame the ideological differences of the Cold War Their oral livevirus vaccine became federally licensed in 1962 and was used for over three decades to help eliminate polio globally replacing the Salk vaccine Using these vaccines the threat of polio remains a serious threat only in parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan
