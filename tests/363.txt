Narratology is the study of narrative and narrative structure and the ways that these affect human perception It is an anglicisation of French narratologie coined by Tzvetan Todorov (Grammaire du Décaméron 1969) Its theoretical lineage is traceable to Aristotle (Poetics (Aristotle)
Cognitive narratology is a more recent development that allows for a broader understanding of narrative Rather than focus on the structure of the story cognitive narratology asks "how humans make sense of stories" and "how humans use stories as sensemaking instruments"

 Defining narrative 

Structuralist narratologists like RimmonKenan define narrative fiction as "the narration of a succession of fictional events" 

Cognitive narratologists focus on how people experience something as narrative rather than on the structure of the text itself The sixword story "For sale: baby shoes never worn" is often given as an example that would not qualify as a narrative in the strictly structural approach but that evokes a sense of narrative 

MarieLaure Ryan distinguishes between "a narrative" as an object that can be clearly defined and the quality of narrativity which means "being able to inspire a narrative response” This allows her to understand Video game
History
The origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the Structuralism
In 1966 a special issue of the journal Communications proved highly influential becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a manifesto (1895–1970)

Jonathan Culler (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands 

<blockquote>
implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between "story" a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse and "discourse" the discursive presentation or narration of events
</blockquote>

The Russian Formalists first proposed such a distinction employing the couplet fabula and syuzhet A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse eg histoire/discours histoire/récit story/plot The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and syuzhet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp Bremond Greimas Dundes et al) and modal (Genette Prince et al) narratology The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told while the latter examines the manner of their telling stressing voice point of view the transformation of the chronological order rhythm and frequency Many authors (Sternberg 1993 Paul Ricoeur
Applications
Designating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced The approach is applicable to any narrative and in its classic studies visavis Propp nonliterary narratives were commonly taken up Still the term "narratology" is most typically applied to literary theory and literary criticism as well as film theory and (to a lesser extent) film criticism Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include sociolinguisticsHowever constituent analysis of a type where narremes are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of linguistics semiotics or literary theory
 Narratology in new media 
Digitalmedia theorist and professor Janet Murray theorized a shift in storytelling and narrative structure in the twentieth century as a result of scientific advancement in her 1998 book Hamlet on the Holodeck 
 Electronic literature and cybertext 
Development and exclusive consumption of digital devices and interactivity are key characteristics of electronic literature This has resulted in varying narrative structures of these interactive media Nonlinear narratives serve as the base of many interactive fictions Sometimes used interchangeably with hypertext fiction the reader or player plays a significant role in the creation of a unique narrative developed by the choices they make within the storyworld Stuart Moulthrops Victory Garden (novel)
In his book Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature Espen Aarseth conceived the concept of cybertext a subcategory of ergodic literature to explain how the medium and mechanical organization of the text affects the readers experience:
<blockquote>
when you read from a cybertext you are constantly reminded of inaccessible strategies and paths not taken voices not heard Each decision will make some parts of the text more and others less accessible and you may never know the exact results of your choices; that is exactly what you missed
</blockquote>

The narrative structure or gameworlds of these cybertexts are compared to a labyrinth that invites the player a term Aarseth deems more appropriate than the reader to play explore and discover paths within these texts Two kinds of labyrinths that are referenced by Aarseth are the unicursal labyrinth which holds one single winding path that leads to a hidden center and the multicursal labyrinth synonymous with a maze which is branching and complex with the path and direction chosen by the player These concepts help to distinguish between ergodic (unicursal) and nonergodic literature (multicursal) Some works such as Vladimir Nabokovs Pale Fire have proven to potentially be both depending on the path the reader takes

Theorists of Narratology
Art critic and philosopher Arthur Danto refers to the narrative as describing two separate events
Narrative is also linked to language The way a story can be manipulated by a character or in the display of medium contributes to how a story is seen by the world 
Narratology as defined by Shlomith RimmonKenan is a branch of narrative theory The concept of narratology was developed mainly in France during the sixties and seventies 
Theorists have argued for a long time about the form and context of narratology American psychologist Robert Sternburg argued that narratology is "structuralism at variance with the idea of structure” This basis goes with the FrenchAmerican belief that narratology is a logical perversion meaning that it followed a course that at the time did not seem logical
Another theorist Peter Brooks (writer)</ref>
Narrative theorist Roland Barthes argues that all narratives have similar structures and in every sentence there are multiple meanings
Barthes sees literature as "writerly text" which does not need a typical plot that has a beginning middle and end Instead written work "has multiple entrances and exits"
Theorist Greimas agrees with other theorists by acknowledging that there is a structure in narrative and set out to find the deep structure of narrativity However in his findings Greimas says that narratology can be used to describe phenomena outside of the written word and linguistics as a whole He establishes a connection between the physical form of something and the language used to describe that something which breaks the structural code that many other theorists base their research on
