Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) is a histopathology
It has been subsequently proposed that macrophagic myofasciitis is in fact a systemic disorder where various diseases develop in association and as consequence of vaccination with aluminiumcontaining vaccines in susceptible individuals however the World Health Organization has concluded that "there is no evidence to suggest that MMF is a specific illness" and that "the current evidence neither establishes nor excludes a generalized disorder affecting other organs"

 Description 
MMF was first described in 1998 by a consortium of French myopathologists as an emerging condition of unknown cause characterised by a defining lesion observed upon muscle biopsy MMF was identified in patients affected by myalgia and fatigue MMF was judged a consequence of a switch to intramuscular injection and the deltoid muscle being the preferred site of both vaccine injection and biopsy in France (while other sites were preferred for biopsy in other countries) and the commencement of Hepatitis B vaccine
Many of those with MMF had previously been treated for malaria with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine

As of 2009 with few exceptions MMF had only been reported in France
