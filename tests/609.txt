Extinct isotopes of superheavy elements are isotopes of superheavy elements whose halflives were too short to have lasted through the formation of the Solar System and because they are not replenished by natural processes can nowadays only be found as their decay product
 Carbonaceous chondrite fission xenon 
Carbonaceous chondrite fission xenon often abbreviated as CCF Xe are a collection of different isotopes of xenon that were thought to have arisen from the decay of a superheavy element within the island of stability Early studies proposed that the half life of the theoretical progenitor of CCF Xe to be on the order of 10<sup>8</sup> years A later attempt at characterization of the progenitor in 1975 by Edward Anders a professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago and colleague John Larimer suggested a heat of vaporization of 54 kJ/mol and a boiling point of 2500K for the element and based on estimated accretion temperatures they also proposed elements 111 and 115 (today named roentgenium and moscovium) <! What are elements 111 and 115? I think it would be better if you made use of the table on the right by writing down the element numbers >as the most likely candidates assuming the element condensed in pure form

 Allende meteorite 

Anders went on to study samples of the Allende meteorite the largest carbonaceous chondrite ever found on Earth Results of these studies suggested elements 111â€“115 (today roentgenium copernicium nihonium flerovium and moscovium) as the most likely candidates for the progenitor of CCF Xe These studies also proposed that the progenitor condensed as an iron chromium sulfide This was later called into question as iron chromium sulfide is very rare with a relative abundance of 04%

 Evidence against carbonaceous fission xenon 
By the 1980s CCF Xe actually being the product of fission was doubtful and the alternate theory that it had arisen from rprocess
