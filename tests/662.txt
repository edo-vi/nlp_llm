Western study of China was changing however John K Fairbank went to Morse for scholarly guidance in 1929 and considered himself a disciple He wrote that although the older scholar lived through the decades of foreign imperialism and the collapse of the Qing empire his historical work "avoids the obtrusive chauvinism of the Western treaty port community of that period" He recalled that "to me as to other beginners he offered generous encouragement and wise counsel" Fairbank characterized The International Relations of the Chinese Empire as "the most comprehensive history of modern China" in its time but added that it was "foreigndocumented bluebook history" that is diplomatic history which described foreign wars and treaties&nbsp;– "what was done in and to China by foreigners" He noted that in the 1930s a new generation of China specialists (including himself) chose to explore and emphasize the Chinese part of the story and what he called "Chinas Response to the West (book)
