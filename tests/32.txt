Borrelia anserina is a helical spirochete bacterium with dimensions around 820/0203 Micrometre
Cultivation
In microbiological laboratories B anserina bacteria can be grown on special proteinenriched media (rich in ovoalbumins or animal tissue (that contains myoglobin)) in wikt:anaerobicB anserina used to be maintained in embryonic chicken eggs or by serial passages in domestic chickens until in 1986 it was discovered that it could be cultivated in BarbourStoennerKelly (BSK) medium which facilitated and made future research more costeffective

Pathogenity
B anserina is a pathogenic agent for poultry (chickens turkeys ducks etc) and causes a disease called borreliosis or spirochetosis This bacterium is transmitted from bird to bird by ticks from the Argas and Ornitodorus<! Ornithodoros? > genera The major symptoms of an infection with B anserina are: anemia diarrhea and severe neurological dysfunctions
