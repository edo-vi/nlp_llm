The potential for contact immunity exists primarily in "live" or attenuated vaccines Vaccination with a live but attenuated virus can produce immunity to more dangerous forms of the virus These attenuated viruses produce little or no illness in most people However the live virus multiplies briefly may be shed in body fluids or feces
The most prominent example of contact immunity was the Polio vaccineOral vaccine              
The main drawback of live virusâ€“based vaccines is that a few people who are vaccinated or exposed to those who have been vaccinated may develop severe disease Those with immunodeficiency                
Contact immunity differs from herd immunity a different type of group protection in which risk for unimmunized individuals is reduced if they are surrounded by immunized individuals who are unlikely to contract harbor or transmit the disease
