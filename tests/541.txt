 History 
File:T10d009Histoire des deux indesVignettepngIn the 19th century vignettes were found in newspapers and acted as brief and vivid descriptions of the news article’s subject from the perspective of the writer According to Norman Sims (2007) these vignette sketches “provided writers with something we often miss today: the opportunity to write about ordinary life” By blending fact and fiction journalists could use their writing to explore their uncertainties and speculations about the subject

During the 19th century vignettes were written by anonymous authors and attributed to the newspaper or journal they featured in They were reused for new audiences and were therefore being constantly revised and recontextualised
File:Example of vignetting and dusty scanjpgLater in the 19th century vignettes in newspapers declined in use and popularity Journalism and literature separated into different distinct branches of writing until literary journalism emerged in the late 19th century
File:Sketches by Boz  The Streets MorningjpgAside from journalism vignettes in the form of the “Literary Sketch
Dickens’ sketches often described brief and immediate scenes of everyday life

Due to the rise of Postmodern literature
 Style 
Vignettes are written in a brief concise style They are rich in imagery to create a vivid detailed description of a moment in time and a character’s immediate experiences

While Short story
As vignettes are often brief and do not allow for elaborate plot or character development many writers craft vignettes to be part of a larger story or idea For example Sandra Cisneros
Vignettes also appear in other creative forms such as web series television shows and films For example the web series High Maintenance uses vignettes to explore the lives of a different set of characters in each episode This series uses the vignette style to vividly portray themes of the human condition such as boredom and loneliness Movies and television shows also use vignettes to reveal more details about the inner world and past lives of characters In the 1989 romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally
Vignettes are also used in psychological research (see also: Vignette (psychology)) In research vignettes act as short descriptions about a hypothetical situation to which survey participants respond with their perceptions beliefs attitudes and how they would react to the given situation The wording of these vignette scenarios are experimentally controlled by the researcher and different versions of the vignette may be randomly assigned to different participants These vignettes may be based on previous research findings or based on reallife examples A potential limitation of using vignettes in psychological research is that individuals may respond differently to these fictional scenarios than their reallife response Vignettes can also be used to provide a fictional example of a psychological concept Vignettes have primarily been used by North American psychologists and in surveys
