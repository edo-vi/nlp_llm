A Panoram measured  tall by  wide by  deep and employed a series of mirrors to reflect the image from a projector onto a  rearprojection ground glass
With the beginning of World War II production of the Panoram machines was drastically reduced due to a wartime shortage of raw materials and the Mills Panorams 1940 success started to fade Soundies (the 16mm media used in the Panoram) continued to be produced and distributed to Panoram locations until 1947 By then the novelty of the visual jukebox was compromised owing to the availability of the television Panoram machines were repurposed as educational filmplaying units or more commonly as adult peep shows The latter caused the introduction of regulation of Panorams to control placement of the units in many cities

The Panoram is now best known for the vast library of short threeminute music videos that were created for it Called Soundies these films featured many of the great musical stars of the period including Duke Ellington Count Basie and Cab Calloway Most of the approximately 1800 Soundies films survive and are considered a priceless archive of 1940s popular music and performers The Soundies films were printed backwards (mirror image) so that they would appear in a correct orientation when played in a Panoram machine Several of the short films were wound on a roll and delivered to Panoramhosted locations as replacement media In this manner new Soundies could be viewed at the location and the entertainment would remain fresh Many Soundies can be viewed on YouTube today including some by bandleader Al Donahue who made 7 or 8 of the first Soundies at Radio City Music Hall

The basic concept behind the Panoram would be revived in the early 1960s with the Scopitone
