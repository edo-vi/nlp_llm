Many vaccines require refrigeration to remain active and the lack of infrastructure to maintain the cool chain to reliably bring vaccines into more remote areas of developing countries poses a serious challenge to national immunization programs Portable vaccine cooler units have been proposed by several technologists The WHO Performance Quality and Safety (PQS) programme is a driver of the technology

Technology development
In 2005 Ian Tansley of Sure Chill designed an icechest vaccine cooler regulated by the density of water Since water has greatest density at around 4&nbsp;°C putting the vaccine chamber at the bottom of a thermosyphon regulates the temperature at between 2&nbsp;°C and 8&nbsp;°C as long as there is ice and the heatexchange capacity is not overloaded Sure Chill claimed to be WHO approved and in use for vaccine storage in 46 countries

A refrigeration device was shown for this purpose by Adam Grosser at a TED Talk in 2007 but had not been produced commercially as of 2020 Grossers proposed device uses exposure to a cooking fire for 30 minutes to store heat After a cooling period of an hour the device is placed into a 15litre container which contains the vaccine His concept calls for a 24hour recycle period

It was revealed in March 2008 that another class of longterm Vaccine Cooler is based around an Ice Box with separate Ice and Vaccine chambers Using ice as the energy storage device allows the Vaccine Cooler to operate for long periods without power: separating the vaccine chamber from the ice chamber allows temperature regulation while avoiding the need for special packing and conditioning of the cold packs Suggestions have included the use of a regulated heat pipe to connect the vaccine chamber and the ice chamber

In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a threeyear project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity and that his team had completed a prototype of his renewal of the Einstein refrigerator He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the designs efficiency to be quadrupled The three working fluids in this design are water ammonia and butane
