Vaccination and religion have interrelations of varying kinds No major religion prohibits vaccinations and some consider it an obligation because of the potential to save lives However some people cite religious adherence  as  Vaccine hesitancy
 Historical 
The influential Massachusetts preacher Cotton Mather was the first known person to attempt smallpox inoculation on a large scale inoculating himself and more than two hundred members of his congregation with the help of a local doctor While his view later became standard there was a strong negative reaction against him at the time

Rowland Hill (preacher)

Several Boston clergymen and devout physicians formed a society that opposed vaccination in 1798 Others complained that the practice was dangerous going so far as to demand that doctors who carried out these procedures be tried for attempted murder

In 1816 Iceland made the clergy responsible for smallpox vaccination and gave them the responsibility of keeping vaccination records for their parishes; Sweden also had similar practices

When vaccination was introduced into United Kingdom
Antivaccinationists were most common in Protestant countries Those who were religious often came from minority religious movements outside of mainstream Protestantism including Quakers in England and Baptists in Sweden

Catholic and Anglican missionaries vaccinated Northwest Coast Native Americans during an 1862 smallpox epidemic

In the United Kingdom
Jehovahs Witnesses condemned the practice of vaccination in 1931 as "a direct violation of the everlasting covenant that God made with Noah after the flood" but reversed that policy in 1952 The decision of whether to vaccinate themselves or their family is left to individuals Some more recent Jehovahs Witness publications have mentioned the success of vaccination programs

Some Christian right
Islam and Judaism religions with dietary prohibitions that regard particular animals as unclean make exceptions for medical treatments derived from those animals However this may not be universally accepted due to a lack of central authority in these religions For example in Aceh Province an autonomous province of Indonesia with its own Islamic Sharia Law eighty percent of people refuse all vaccinations due to concerns about pig or its derivatives being used to make some vaccines (eating pig is considered haram)

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints has made vaccination an official initiative in its humanitarian relief program The Church has also called on its members to see that their own children are properly vaccinated In March 2021 the Church added encouragement to vaccinate to its General Handbook of Instructions noting that "Vaccinations administered by competent medical professionals protect health and preserve life Members of the Church are encouraged to safeguard themselves their children and their communities through vaccination" In August 2021 the Church again encouraged vaccination specifically against COVID19 in a public statement from the First Presidency (LDS Church)
Although the Church of Christ Scientist encourages reliance on prayer it does not forbid vaccination or any other medical practice  and in recent years it did not renew its application for religious exemption for vaccinations in Australia because it deemed the exemption "no longer current or necessary"

In 2003 imams in northern Nigeria advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine perceived to be a plot by Westerners to decrease Muslim fertility The boycott caused the number of polio cases to rise not only in Nigeria but also in neighboring countries The followers were also wary of other vaccinations and Nigeria reported more than twenty thousand measles cases and nearly six hundred deaths from measles from January through March 2005 In 2006 Nigeria accounted for more than half of all new polio cases worldwide Outbreaks continued thereafter; for example at least 200 children died in a late2007 measles outbreak in Borno State In 2013 nine health workers administering polio vaccine were targeted and killed by gunmen on motorcycles in Kano (city)
In the 2000s in Poliomyelitis in Pakistan
In 2015 leaders of the Nation of Islam spoke out against a California Bill that removed philosophical exemptions to school vaccination requirements alleging a link between MMR vaccine and autism They also said that government mandated vaccines were another Tuskegee Syphilis Study

According to a March 2021 poll conducted by The Associated Press/NORC at the University of Chicago
 Exemptions 
In the US all states except Mississippi California West Virginia Maine and New York (state)
On January 1 2016 Australia introduced legislation that removed eligibility for childcare and welfare benefits if parents refuse to vaccinate their children removing religious exemptions at the same time as the only religion to apply for an exemption (Church of Christ Scientist) deemed their exemption to no longer be relevant
