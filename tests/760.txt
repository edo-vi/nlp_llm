 Professional career 

 Asia Golf Circuit 
Singh turned professional in 1982 Two years later he won the 1984 Malaysian PGA Championship However his career was plunged into crisis after he was suspended from the Asia Golf Circuit in 1985 over allegations he doctored his scorecard It was alleged that he lowered his score from one over to one under in order to make the cut but Singh denies this saying that in any case it should only have resulted in disqualification from the event rather than a ban After investigation by the Tour of this and other alleged violations proved true John Bender Asian PGA Tour president issued Singh a lifetime ban on Asian PGA Tour play

Singh felt he had been more harshly treated because the marker was "the son of a VIP in the Indonesian PGA" He then took a job at the Keningau Club in Sabah Malaysia before his move to the Miri Golf Club in Sarawak While this was a period of hardship for him he continued to gain experience

 European Tour 
Singh saved the money he needed to resurrect his career and began to reenter tournaments In 1988 he teamed up with a sponsor Red Baron which funded a trip to Africa to compete on the nowdefunct Safari Circuit an offshoot circuit of the European Tour Singh captured his first event the 1988 Nigerian Open locals cheered him loudly At the end of that year he entered the European Tour Qualifying school for the second consecutive year and was successful on this occasion

In 1989 Singh won his first European Tour title at the Volvo Open Championship in Italy and finished 24th on the European Tour Order of Merit putting his early struggles firmly behind him He won four times in 1989 at the Volvo Open di Firenze Ivory Coast Open Nigerian Open and Zimbabwe Open He also finished tied for 23rd at The Open Championship He won on the European Tour again in 1990 and did so twice in 1992 He also won several tournaments in Asia and Africa in this period

PGA Tour
Singh earned membership for the PGA Tour in 1993 winning his first tournament the Buick Classic in a playoff over Mark Wiebe That victory led to his being named the 1993 PGA Tour Rookie of the Year After being hampered with back and neck problems in 1994 he came back to win the Buick Classic again in 1995 as well as the Phoenix Open After playing well in 1996 (but with no victories) he won both the Memorial Tournament and the Buick Open in 1997

In 1998 Singh was victorious at the PGA Championship at Sahalee Country Club in Sammamish Washington playing a 70666768 over the four days (the 66 tied a course record) and earning him his first Major title He followed this up by winning The Masters in 2000 Masters Tournament
Singh did not win on the PGA Tour in 2001 but finished the year with a Tourbest 14 top10 finishes and was fourth on the money list with $3440829 for the year In 2002 he won at the Shell Houston Open at TPC at The Woodlands setting a new tournament 72hole scoring record with a 266 and at the Tour Championship winning by two strokes over Charles Howell III

2003 proved to be a very successful year for Singh He won four tournaments had 18 top10 finishes and was the PGA Tours money leader (and had the secondhighest singleseason total in PGA Tour history) with $7573907 beating Tiger Woods by $900494 though Singh played 27 tournaments compared to Woods 18 tournaments Singh also tied a 9hole scoring record at the 2003 US Open Golf Championship
However the 2003 season was also spotted with controversy involving Singh surrounding the years event at the Bank of America Colonial LPGA star Annika Sörenstam became the first woman to play at a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias at the 1945 Los Angeles Open Surrounding this fervor Singh was misquoted as having said that Sörenstam "didnt belong" on the mens tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her What he actually said is that he would not be paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champions pool Singh later clarified "There are guys out there trying to make a living Its not a ladies tour If she wants to play she should—or any other woman for that matter—if they want to play the mans tour they should qualify and play like everybody else"

Singh began 2004 by winning the AT&T Pebble Beach National ProAm at −16 and winning $954000 in prize money This was his first win on tour in 2004 and his 16th alltime on the PGA Tour It was his 12th consecutive top10 finish which is two shy of Jack Nicklaus alltime record

A new swing brought big changes for Singh in 2008 although he had good opportunities at AT&T Pebble Beach National ProAm
Singh has won 22 times on the PGA Tour since turning 40 – beating the record previously set by Sam Snead He is the second man to reach $60&nbsp;million in PGA Tour career earnings after Tiger Woods His 34 career victories are the most on the PGA Tour by a nonAmerican player and place him 14th on the alltime list He has spent List of male golfers who have been in the world top 10
Kenny Perry another player who found success at a late age is good friends with Singh who calls him "Biggie" Of Singh Perry said "Vijay has always been good to me We talk a lot He wants to know how my family is doing I think the world of him"

After the 2008 playoffs Singh announced his withdrawal from a couple of Asian Tour events because of a nagging back injury and was advised by doctors to rest He missed two and a half months returning to win Tiger Woodss tournament the Chevron World Challenge at Sherwood Country Club in California in December It was his first victory in the event During the start of the 2009 season Singh announced that he would miss three weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee Singh had a mediocre 2009 season with no top 5 finishes and ended the year with his lowest ever ranking on the PGA Tour money list in 68th

After Singhs win at the Masters Ernie Els took issue with some of the negative press his friend received He wrote an article in Sports Illustrated to defend him saying "Golf should be proud of Vijay Singh" Later Els said of Singh "Hes a wonderful guy Ive known him for the better part of 10 years now Hes a great competitor I think people have a misconception of Vijay Hes a really good guy"

In May 2005 Singh was appointed a goodwill ambassador for Fiji He said that he did not expect anything in return from the Fijian government for representing his country At a press conference on 18 May 2005 Singh commented on what he said was a deterioration in race relations in Fiji saying that for such a small country people of all races should live together put their differences aside and get on with life Relations between Indians in Fiji
