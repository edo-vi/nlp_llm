Origins
One of the first of such texts would be John Locke
In literature
Originating in philosophical and scientific writings sensibility became an Englishlanguage literary movement particularly in the thennew genre of the novel Such works called sentimental novels featured individuals who were prone to sensibility often weeping fainting feeling weak or having fits in reaction to an emotionally moving experience If one were especially sensible one might react this way to scenes or objects that appear insignificant to others This reactivity was considered an indication of a sensible persons ability to perceive something intellectually or emotionally stirring in the world around them However the popular sentimental genre soon met with a strong backlash as antisensibility readers and writers contended that such extreme behavior was mere histrionics and such an emphasis on ones own feelings and reactions a sign of narcissism Samuel Johnson in his portrait of Miss Gentle articulated this criticism:
<blockquote>
She daily exercises her benevolence by pitying every misfortune that happens to every family within her circle of notice; she is in hourly terrors lest one should catch cold in the rain and another be frighted by the high wind Her charity she shews by lamenting that so many poor wretches should languish in the streets and by wondering what the great can think on that they do so little good with such large estates
</blockquote>

Criticism
Objections to sensibility emerged on other fronts  For one some conservative thinkers believed in A priori knowledge
The effusive nature of many sentimental heroes such as Harley in Henry Mackenzies 1771 novel The Man of Feeling was often decried by contemporary critics as celebrating a weak effeminate character which ultimately contributed to a discrediting of previously popular sentimental novels (and to a lesser extent all novels) as unmanly works This concern coincided with a marked rise in the production of novels by women writers of the period whether they chose to write in a sentimental mode or not and played a significant role in larger debates about gender genre literary value and nationalist political aims during the last decade of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth when the "National Tale" concept emerged in the wake of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Acts of Union 1800
