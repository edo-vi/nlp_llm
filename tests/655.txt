A kleptoprotein is a protein which is not encoded in the genome of the organism which uses it but instead is obtained through diet from a prey organism. Importantly a kleptoprotein must maintain its function and be mostly or entirely undigested drawing a distinction from proteins that are digested for nutrition which become destroyed and non-functional in the process.

This phenomenon was first reported in the bioluminescent fish Parapriacanthus which has specialized light organs adapted towards counter-illumination but obtains the luciferase enzyme within these organs from bioluminescent ostracods including Cypridina noctiluca or Vargula hilgendorfii.
