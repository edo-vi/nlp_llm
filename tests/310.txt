File:Ebola Outbreak Map (ongoing)pngVaccine development and production is economically complex and prone to market failure Many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine including HIV malaria and tuberculosis exist principally in poor countries Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases because there is little revenue potential Even in more affluent countries financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great

Most vaccine development to date has relied on "push" funding by government universities and nonprofit organizations Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades  This increase particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools may be due to government mandates and support rather than economic incentive

Market concentration
While vaccine research and development is done by many small companies largescale vaccine manufacturing is done by an oligopoly of big manufacturers A March 2020 New York Times article described the political effects of this market structure: "government and international health organizations know that any vaccine developed in a lab will ultimately be manufactured by large pharmaceutical firms At this critical juncture with coronavirus no health expert would publicly criticize drug companies but privately they complain that pharma is a major speed bump in developing lifesaving vaccines"

Concentration and monopolization of the manufacture of specific drugs has also led to supply shortages and significant healthcare costs for employing people to track down hardtoget drugs

This oligopoly power allows vaccine manufacturers to engage in price discrimination and vaccine prices are often two orders of magnitude higher than the manufacturers stated manufacturing costs  Sales agreements often require that the buyer keeps the price secret and agrees to other noncompetitive restrictions; the exact nature and extent of this problem is hard to characterize due to agreements being secret Price secrecy also disadvantages vaccine purchasers in price negotiations It also makes market analysis difficult and hinders efforts to improve affordability

The first decade of the 2000s saw a large number of mergers and acquisitions and  80% of the global vaccine market was in the hands of five multinationals: GlaxoSmithKline Sanofi Pasteur Pfizer Merck Group
Epidemic response
In the past the market power of pharmaceutical companies has delayed responses to epidemics Manufacturers have successfully negotiated favourable terms including market guarantees and indemnification from governments as a condition of manufacturing vaccines This has delayed responses to some epidemics by months and prevented responses to other pandemics entirely

Market incentives
There is also no business incentive for pharmaceutical companies to test vaccines that are only of use to poor people Vaccines developed for rich countries may also have short expiry dates
and requirements that they be cold chain
In almost all cases pharmaceuticals including vaccines are developed with public funding but profits and control of price and availability are legally accorded to private companies The profits of large pharmaceutical companies are mostly used on dividends and share buybacks which inflate executive pay low percentage R&D spending is sometimes touted as an attraction to investors The financialization focus of the pharmaceutical industry especially in the US has been cited as an obstacle to innovation

There have been ethical issues raised with accepting donations of generally unaffordable vaccines

 Demand 
While the vaccine market makes up only 23% of the pharmaceutical market worldwide it is growing at 1015% per year much faster than other pharmaceuticals ()
Vaccine demand is increasing with new target population in emerging markets (partly due to international vaccine funders; in 2012 UNICEF bought half of the worlds vaccine doses) Vaccines are becoming the financial driver of the pharmaceutical industry and new business models may be emerging Vaccines are newly being marketed like pharmaceuticals

Vaccines offer new opportunities for funding from publicprivate partnerships (such as Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations
 Public domain 

Baker (2016) observed that the vast majority of the cost of most diagnostic preventive and treatment procedures are patent royalties:  The unit costs are almost universally a tiny fraction of the price to the consumer  Moreover in the US "the government spends more than $30 billion a year on biomedical research through the
National Institutes of Health"  And researchers (individuals and organizations) routinely obtain patents on products whose development was paid for by taxpayers per the w:Bayhâ€“Dole Act
Moreover the cost of those diagnostic preventive and treatment procedures would be lower the world over if the results of publiclyfunded research were in the public domain  This would likely lead to better control of infectious diseases worldwide  That in turn would likely reduced the disease load in the US
