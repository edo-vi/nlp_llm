A nonrenewable resource (also called a finite resource) is a natural resource that cannot be readily replaced by natural means at a pace quick enough to keep up with consumption An example is carbonbased fossil fuels The original organic matter with the aid of heat and pressure becomes a fuel such as oil or gas Earth minerals and metal ores fossil fuels (coal petroleum natural gas) and groundwater in certain aquifers are all considered nonrenewable resources though individual Chemical element
Conversely resources such as timber (when Sustainable forest management
 Earth minerals and metal ores

Earth minerals and metal ores are examples of nonrenewable resources The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earths crust (geology)
The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are nonrenewable in human timeframes There are certain rare earth minerals and rare earth element
 Fossil fuels 



Natural resources such as coal petroleum(crude oil) and natural gas take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed Eventually it is considered that fossilbased resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power see renewable energy

An alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms if one includes all sources of carbonbased energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined These sources of carbon are also considered nonrenewable although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known However their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined

At present the main energy source used by humans is nonrenewable fossil fuels Since the dawn of internal combustion engine technologies in the 19th century petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand As a result conventional infrastructure and transport systems which are fitted to combustion engines remain prominent throughout the globe

The modernday fossil fuel economy is widely criticized for its lack of renewability as well as being a contributor to climate change

In 1987 the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) classified fission reactors that produce more fissile nuclear fuel than they consume (ie breeder reactors) among conventional renewable energy sources such as Sun
The use of nuclear technology relying on Nuclear fission
As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in pilot programs and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium leaching (metallurgy)
Nuclear power provides about 6% of the worlds energy and 13â€“14% of the worlds electricity Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous radioactive contamination as it relies upon unstable elements In particular nuclear power facilities produce about 200000 metric tons of low and intermediate level waste (LILW) and 10000 metric tons of high level waste (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide

Issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the highlevel radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained is Acute radiation syndrome
 Land surface 
Land surface can be considered both renewable and nonrenewable resource depending on the scope of comparison land economics

The renewable energy from the sun wind surface wave
The potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand Hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs Geothermal energy can provide 15 more times the energy we need There is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over wind power could power all of humanitys needs alone Solar currently supplies only 01% of our world energy needs but there is enough out there to power humanitys needs 4000 times over the entire global projected energy demand by 2050
