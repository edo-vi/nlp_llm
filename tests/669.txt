 History 

 2014 
An outbreak of Plague (disease)
On 4 November 2014 the Ministry of Health of Madagascar reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization

On 11 February 2015 the WHO and Madagascar Ministry of Health released a followup situation report the outbreak The report stated the outbreak beginning in September 2014 peaked from November through endDecember and had slowed down as of February 2015 The WHO report cited 263 cases and 71 deaths with a 27% fatality rate  Efficient identification and treatment with antibiotics were noted as critical to treatment efficacy evidenced by fatality rates ranging from 15%  60% depending on early identification and treatment The report explained that Madagascars plague “season” typically runs through April and stopped short of officially declaring the outbreak over

 2017 
A more recent outbreak of plague in Madagascar began in August 2017 and expanded rapidly with about twothirds of cases transmitted persontoperson as pneumonic plague the most dangerous form of the disease The death toll of 124 by 20 October exceeded that of previous outbreaks More than half of cases have been recorded in the capital of Antananarivo and the main port of Toamasina the largest cities in Madagascar Nine nearby countries were considered at high risk of a similar outbreak The outbreak appeared to peak in midOctober with the number of new cases declining Typically the annual plague outbreak peaks in December and runs until April

On 2 November a ProMEDmail moderator expressed surprise at the considerable variation reported in numbers of cases and deaths especially with the relatively low casefatality rate considering that pneumonic plague is reported to account for over 60 percent of deaths An article from the World Health Organization reported more than 1800 cases as of late October while nearly 500 fewer had been reported in the week previously

In January 2018 the experts declared the outbreak over as no new cases had been reported since November 2017 although the World health organization stated that there was a "moderate" chance of reoccurrence Malagasy Prime Minister Olivier Mahafaly Solonandrasana had declared the crisis over on 23 November 2017

 August 
The outbreak began in August 2017 with the death from pneumonic plague of a 31yearold man who had been traveling in a crowded minibus toward the capital city of Antananarivo in the central highlands The outbreak expanded rapidly transmitted persontoperson in the pneumonic form of the disease which accounted for more than 60 percent of cases  Scientists discovered three new strains of Y pestis in Madagascar in 2017 Additionally one strain of Y pestis was found to be resistant to antibiotic treatment Because of plague moving from rural to urban areas there is increased risk of transmission to other countries Urban areas that are  major transportation hubs for shipping and recreation are at high risk for transmitting plague to nearby countries

 September–October 
The outbreak was initially recognized on 11 September by local authorities and confirmed by the Pasteur Institute
 November 
By 8 November deaths had risen to 165 with infections totalling over 2000 however the rate of spread had slowed raising hope that the outbreak was starting to come under control Concerns continued to be raised that plague might still spread to neighboring countries or mutate to a form that could be more difficult to treat By 15 November there had been 171 deaths and 2119 total cases of plague however no new infections had been reported since 28 October

 Background 
Plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is most commonly transmitted through infected fleas There are three types of plague: bubonic pneumonic and septicemic Bubonic plague is the most wellknown type This type of plague results in swollen lymph nodes that are called buboes This type of plague is treatable with antibiotics but if not treated effectively the infection can spread to different parts of the body Pneumonic plague occurs when plague infects the lungs and is transmissible person to person through infected droplets This form of plague is very deadly Septicemic plague occurs when plague enters the blood Skin and tissues turn black and die and bleeding into skin and organs often occurs This form of plague is also deadly Pneumonic plague and septicemic plague often occur when bubonic plague goes untreated and are difficult to diagnose

 Endemic plague 
Plague has endemically resided in Madagascar since it was first brought to the island from India in 1898 on the Central Highlands (Madagascar)
 Confounding factors 

 Rural to urban 
When an endemic disease such as Ebola or plague is introduced to a new geographic area that is densely populated with international shipping routes it increases transmission rates and leads to severe outbreaks and potential pandemics Although urban areas like Antananarivo and Mahajanga are more affluent they are still impoverished in global comparison Insufficient waste management lack of clean water and poor infrastructure are all issues that are breeding grounds for rats and fleas and therefore perpetuate plague transmission in urban areas Furthermore the rattoflea cycle of transmission has not changed since the first pandemic of plague This type of consistency allows the organism to become more infectious

 Rats and fleas 
High rates of plague transmission have been associated with low rat abundance and high volume of flea vectors Historically rats who acted as hosts to the flea vector subsequently died once they were infected with plague However the organism evolved and scientists are now finding that rats are not dying from plague This means that plague survives longer in the host and allows for the bacteria to live longer and potentially infect more people The elevation of the mountains where most of the agriculture takes place in addition to the ideal climate that allows rats and fleas to prosper scientists have seen plague thrive in Madagascars climate compared to other countries where there is endemic plague

 Evolution of bacteria 
Scientists discovered three new strains of Y pestis in Madagascar in 2017 Additionally one strain of Y pestis was found to be resistant to antibiotic treatment Because of plague moving from rural to urban areas there is increased risk for transmission to other countries Urban areas that are a major transportation hub for shipping and recreation are at high risk for transmitting plague to nearby countries

 Agriculture 
Plague in Madagascar is predominantly a rural disease related to agricultural activities  Plague "season" (October through April) coincides with the hot and rainy season in the agricultural highlands Rats do not thrive in cold climate and therefore are more prevalent during this time of year Rice is a vital crop in Madagascar and due to the high prevalence of fleas and rats in agricultural areas plague bacteria often infects crops and soil Many scientists have found that the plague bacteria Y pestis can live in soil for months at a time

 Burial practices 
In addition to agricultural factors that increase prevalence of plague burial practices in Madagascar also spread disease Famadihana is a burial practice in Madagascar that is practiced among the Malagasy people It is commonly known as "turning of the bones" Family members exhume their deceased family members from the family crypts and wrap them up in fresh cloth Then they dance around the crypt with the body to live music This custom is based on a belief that the dead do not join the rest of their ancestors until their body reaches full decomposition with appropriate ceremonies This process could take up to several years and involves direct contact with corpses This burial practice perpetuates the spread of plague among other diseases

 Poverty 
Plague is symptomatic of poverty Rats and fleas thrive in rural and urban areas of Madagascar due to the impoverishment of the country Lack of proper infrastructure lack of sanitation and waste removal little clean water and scarce health facilities create a perfect breeding ground for rats and fleas to thrive Although plague is prevalent in other countries Madagascar has the highest fatality and accounts for 30% of all plague cases largely due to poverty and lack of health resources like antibiotics and proper testing Furthermore outbreaks of plague have become increasingly more severe due to bubonic plague going untreated and developing into pneumonic plague Once plague becomes pneumonic it is significantly more contagious and is transmittable person to person

 Severity 
Recently plague outbreaks have become increasingly more severe The most recent outbreak in August 2017 is the worst to date with over 1800 confirmed cases of plague Of these confirmed cases 1100 of them were cases of pneumonic plague 114 districts of Madagascar were affected by the plague outbreak Usually endemic plague only affects around 20 rural districts This outbreak was different in nature due to the fact that the plague shifted from rural geographic location to urban geographic location Plague was found in major shipping ports like Mahajanga and in the capital Antananarivo The capital alone is home to 27 million people Plague moving into urban areas increased transmission rates due to the high volume of people living in these areas and the amount of trade traffic that occurs on a daily basis

Response to the disease
Madagascar proposed a National Plague Control Program which is a surveillance program run by the government and the Ministry of Health that is based on immediate notification of every suspected case of plague Every case reported to the National Plague Control Program is treated with antibiotics In addition to this course of treatment insecticide is brought to the home or work for flea control Although the ideas and intentions of the National Plague Control Program are good and in theory could be very beneficial to treating and preventing outbreaks of plague severe economic limitations make the execution of this program less than ideal Furthermore disparities in rural areas compared to urban areas make accessibility and testing in rural areas challenging Economic resources need to be strengthened before this program can live up to its full potential After the most recent major outbreak the WHO created a Crisis Emergency Committee to monitor the situation They deployed epidemiologists doctors and risk management coordinators in order to coordinate surveillance facilitate tracing contacts oversee case management administer isolation protocol and distribute supplies In addition to the new committee Madagascar reallocated funds in order to help with isolation treatment and supplies These solutions to the outbreak helped as cases of plague declined and hospitalized patients decreased in volume

Other countries
Twelve more cases of suspected plague appeared in the Seychelles days after the death of a 34yearold male who had recently traveled to Madagascar and who was confirmed as having pneumonic plague on 10 October 2017 Air Seychelles suspended all flights to Madagascar More sophisticated tests later showed that the infection was not plague

A South African basketball player who contracted plague while attending a tournament in Madagascar was successfully treated and returned home The type of plague the player had was not reported but one of the cases in the Seychelles who died of pneumonic plague was thought to have attended the same tournament

The World Health Organization warned that there was a high risk the disease could spread to nine other countries in Africa and the Indian Ocean (Ethiopia Kenya Tanzania Mozambique South Africa Seychelles Comoros Reunion and Mauritius) because of frequent trade and travel with Madagascar
