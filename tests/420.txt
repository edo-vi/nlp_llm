Spread to Mbandaka
In the eight previous Ebola outbreaks in DRC since 1976 the virus had never before reached a major city In May 2018 for the first time four cases were confirmed in the city of Mbandaka

On 14 May suspected cases were reported in the Iboko and Wangata areas in Province of Équateur
The DRC government was particularly concerned about the virus spreading by boat transport along the Congo between Mbandaka and the capital Kinshasa The WHO also considered that there was a high risk of the outbreak spreading to nine other countries in the region including the bordering Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic

 the focus of the outbreak was split between Bikoro and Iboko; Iboko had 55% of the confirmed cases of EVD and Bikoro had 815% of the fatalities The cases in the Bikoro health zone were located in Ikoko Impenge (12) Bikoro (6) Momboyo (1) and Moheli (1); those in the Iboko health zone were located in Itipo (13) Mpangi (2) Wenga (1) and Loongo (1)

According to the fifth situation report released by the WHO the case fatality rate (CFR) was 423% On 29 May it was reported that 800 contacts had been identified in the city of Mbandaka; the next day it was reported that 500 people in the city had been vaccinated

On 29 May the WHO indicated that nine neighbouring countries had been alerted for being at high risk of spread of EVD On 4 June it was reported that Angola had closed its border with the DRC due to the outbreak

End of the outbreak
This outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was declared over on 24 July 2018 after 42 days passed without any new confirmed cases Although it was noted that a new outbreak occurred only one week later in the eastern region of Kivu;   and it has  been established that they are not linked

Containment challenges
The Bikoro area had three hospitals but the areas health services were described by WHO as predominantly having "limited functionality"; they received supplies from international bodies but experienced frequent shortages More than half of the Bikoro area cases were in IkokoImpenge a village not connected to the road system Bikoro lies in dense rain forest and the areas remoteness and inadequate infrastructure hindered treatment of EVD patients as well as surveillance and vaccination efforts

Adherence was another challenge: on 20–21 May three individuals with EVD in an isolation ward of a treatment center in Mbandaka fled; two later died after attending a prayer meeting at which they may have exposed 50 other attendees to the virus
Bushmeat was believed to be one vector of infection but bushmeat vendors at the Mbandaka market told reporters that they did not believe Ebola was real or serious Hostility towards health workers trying to offer medical assistance was also reported On 29 May the WHO forecast that there would be 100–300 cases by the end of July

Virology

The virus was named for the Ebola River which runs as a tributary of the Congo River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the Zaire ebolavirus
Response
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) established treatment centers in Bikoro Ikoko and Wangata On 18 May the WHO IHR committee met and decided against declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention The Wellcome Trust  donated £2 million towards the DRC outbreak Merck & Co
US President Donald Trump has advocated rescinding Ebola funding and most financing for State Department emergency responses National Security Advisor John Bolton removed the National Security Councils health security chief on the day that the Ebola outbreak was declared shutting down the entire epidemic prevention office The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says "about five" of its staff advise the Congolese government CDC presence appears to be smaller than West African countries The US Agency for International Development promised $1 million to WHO for Ebola efforts Germany has promised $58 million

Surveillance
Surveillance of travelers at Mbandakas port and airport was performed and on 18 May 2018 a total of 20 countries had instituted screening of travelers coming from the DRC A laboratory commenced operations in Bikoro on 16 May enabling local testing of patient samples for Ebola virus

Burials were organized by MSF and the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to minimize the risk of transmission The United Nations Radio  broadcast EVD awareness information and posters and leaflets were prepared and distributed UNICEF warned 143 churches across Mbandaka of the risks of prayer meetings

Treatment
Ring vaccination with rVSVZEBOV

File:RVSVZEBOVpngFile:Ebola and Contact TracingwebmHealth authorities including DRCs Ministry of Public Health (Democratic Republic of the Congo)
A ring vaccination strategy was used which involves vaccinating only those most likely to be infected: direct contacts of infected individuals and contacts of those contacts Other groups targeted included health workers laboratory personnel surveillance workers and people involved with burials People who were vaccinated were followed up for 84 days to assess whether they were protected from infection and to monitor any adverse events The vaccine must be transported and stored at between −60 and −80&nbsp;°C A cold chain was established in Kinshasa by 18 May and has been extended to Mbandaka WHO planned to concentrate on vaccinating three sets of contacts of confirmed EVD cases two in Bikoro and one in Mbandaka
File:ContainingEbolaattheSourcewithRingVaccinationpntd0005093s003ogvVaccination started on 21 May among health workers in Mbandaka The DRC health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga stated that vaccination of health workers and Ebola case contacts in the Wangata and Bolenge areas of Mbandaka would take five days after which vaccination would start in Bikoro and Iboko  154 people in Mbandaka had been vaccinated and preparations were started for vaccinating in Bikoro and Iboko Up to 1000 people were expected to have been vaccinated by 26 May according to WHO It was the first time that vaccination had been attempted in the early stages of an Ebola outbreak

The rVSVZEBOV vaccine proved effective for the strain of the Ebola virus in this outbreak having via ring vaccination protected some 3481 individuals

Experimental therapeutic agents

The ZMapp cocktail was assessed by the World Health Organization for emergency use under the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions
Prognosis

PostEbola virus syndrome affects those who have survived EVD infection; the resulting signs and symptoms can include muscle pain eye problems and neurological problems

History

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) has had several previous EVD outbreaks since 1976 which are summarised in the Table below All have been located in the west or north of the country Three previous outbreaks (in 1976 1977 and 2014) occurring in Équateur (former province)
In 2014 the WHO considered that the DRC was lagging behind the rest of Africa in List of countries by total health expenditure per capita
For the 2017 Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola virus outbreak the DRC regulatory authorities approved the use of the experimental rVSVZEBOV vaccine but logistical issues delayed its implementation until the outbreak was already under control

Shortly before the first cases of the 2018 Ebola outbreak the country experienced a widespread cholera epidemic (June 2017 – spring 2018) which was the most serious in the country since 1994
