Geomorphology (from Ancient Greek:   "earth";   "form"; and   "study") is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of topography
 Overview 
File:VU0K1843 (39985550)jpg
Earths surface is modified by a combination of surface processes that shape landscapes and geologic processes that cause tectonic uplift and subsidence and shape the coastal geography Surface processes comprise the action of water wind ice wildfire and life on the surface of the Earth along with chemical reactions that form soils and alter material properties the stability and rate of change of topography under the force of gravity and other factors such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape Many of these factors are strongly mediated by climate Geologic processes include the uplift of mountain ranges the growth of volcanoes isostasy
The broadscale topographies of the Earth illustrate this intersection of surface and subsurface action Mountain belts are tectonic uplift
In addition to these broadscale questions geomorphologists address issues that are more specific or more local Glacial geomorphologists investigate glacial deposits such as moraines eskers and proglacial lakes as well as ErosionIce
Geomorphologists use a wide range of techniques in their work These may include fieldwork and field data collection the interpretation of remotely sensed data geochemical analyses and the numerical modelling of the physics of landscapes Geomorphologists may rely on geochronology using dating methods to measure the rate of changes to the surface Terrain measurement techniques are vital to quantitatively describe the form of the Earths surface and include differential GPS remotely sensed digital terrain models and LidarGeology and soil science
Practical applications of geomorphology include natural hazard
Planetary geomorphology studies landforms on other terrestrial planets such as Mars Indications of effects of aeolian processes
 History 
File:Cono de Arita Salar de Arizaro (Argentina)jpgFile:Velke Hincovo plesojpgOther than some notable exceptions in antiquity geomorphology is a relatively young science growing along with interest in other aspects of the earth sciences in the mid19th century This section provides a very brief outline of some of the major figures and events in its development

 Ancient geomorphology 
The study of landforms and the evolution of the Earths surface can be dated back to scholars of Classical Greece In the 5th century BC Greek historiography
Another early theory of geomorphology was devised by Song dynasty History of China
 Early modern geomorphology 
The term geomorphology seems to have been first used by Laumann in an 1858 work written in German Keith Tinkler has suggested that the word came into general use in English German and French after John Wesley Powell and W J McGee used it during the International Geological Conference of 1891 John Edward Marr in his The Scientific Study of Scenery considered his book as an Introductory Treatise on Geomorphology a subject which has sprung from the union of Geology and Geography

An early popular geomorphic model was the geographical cycle or cycle of erosion model of broadscale landscape evolution developed by William Morris Davis between 1884 and 1899 With regard to valley forms for example uniformitarianism posited a sequence in which a river runs through a flat terrain gradually carving an increasingly deep valley until the side valleys eventually erode flattening the terrain again though at a lower elevation It was thought that tectonic uplift could then start the cycle over In the decades following Daviss development of this idea many of those studying geomorphology sought to fit their findings into this framework known today as "Davisian" Daviss ideas are of historical importance but have been largely superseded today mainly due to their lack of predictive power and qualitative nature

In the 1920s Walther Penck developed an alternative model to Daviss He also emphasised that in many landscapes slope evolution occurs by backwearing of rocks not by Davisianstyle surface lowering and his science tended to emphasise surface process over understanding in detail the surface history of a given locality Penck was German and during his lifetime his ideas were at times rejected vigorously by the Englishspeaking geomorphology community

Both Davis and Penck were trying to place the study of the evolution of the Earths surface on a more generalized globally relevant footing than it had been previously In the early 19th century authors – especially in Europe – had tended to attribute the form of landscapes to local climate and in particular to the specific effects of glaciation and periglacial processes In contrast both Davis and Penck were seeking to emphasize the importance of evolution of landscapes through time and the generality of the Earths surface processes across different landscapes under different conditions

During the early 1900s the study of regionalscale geomorphology was termed "physiography" Physiography later was considered to be a contraction of "physical" and "geography" and therefore synonymous with physical geography and the concept became embroiled in controversy surrounding the appropriate concerns of that discipline Some geomorphologists held to a geological basis for physiography and emphasized a concept of physiographic regions of the world
 Climatic geomorphology 

During the age of New Imperialism in the late 19th century European explorers and scientists traveled across the globe bringing descriptions of landscapes and landforms As geographical knowledge increased over time these observations were systematized in a search for regional patterns Climate emerged thus as prime factor for explaining landform distribution at a grand scale The rise of climatic geomorphology was foreshadowed by the work of Wladimir Köppen Vasily Dokuchaev and Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper
Climatic geomorphology was criticized in a 1969 review article by process geomorphologist David Stoddart (geographer)
 Quantitative and process geomorphology 
File:South AfricaMpumalangaGods Window002jpgGeomorphology was started to be put on a solid quantitative footing in the middle of the 20th century Following the early work of Grove Karl Gilbert around the turn of the 20th century These methods began to allow prediction of the past and future behavior of landscapes from present observations and were later to develop into the modern trend of a highly quantitative approach to geomorphic problems Many groundbreaking and widely cited early geomorphology studies appeared in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America and received only few citations prior to 2000 (they are examples of Paper with delayed recognition
Quantitative geomorphology can involve fluid dynamics and solid mechanics geomorphometry laboratory studies field measurements theoretical work and full landscape evolution modeling These approaches are used to understand weathering and pedogenesis
In Sweden Filip Hjulströms doctoral thesis "The River Fyris" (1935) contained one of the first quantitative studies of geomorphological processes ever published His students followed in the same vein making quantitative studies of mass transport (Anders Rapp) fluvial transport (Åke Sundborg) delta deposition (Valter Axelsson) and coastal processes (John O Norrman) This developed into "the Uppsala University
 Contemporary geomorphology 
Today the field of geomorphology encompasses a very wide range of different approaches and interests Modern researchers aim to draw out quantitative "laws" that govern Earth surface processes but equally recognize the uniqueness of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate Particularly important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include:

:1) that not all landscapes can be considered as either "stable" or "perturbed" where this perturbed state is a temporary displacement away from some ideal target form Instead dynamic changes of the landscape are now seen as an essential part of their nature

:2) that many geomorphic systems are best understood in terms of the stochastic process
According to Karna LidmarBergström regional geography is since the 1990s no longer accepted by mainstream scholarship as a basis for geomorphological studies

Albeit having its importance diminished climatic geomorphology continues to exist as field of study producing relevant research More recently concerns over global warming have led to a renewed interest in the field 

Despite considerable criticism the cycle of erosion model has remained part of the science of geomorphology The inherent difficulties of the model have instead made geomorphological research to advance along other lines In contrast to its disputed status in geomorphology the cycle of erosion model is a common approach used to establish denudation chronology
 Processes 
File:Nanga_Parbat_Indus_GorgejpgGeomorphically relevant processes generally fall into
(1) the production of regolith by weathering and erosion
(2) the sediment transport(3) its eventual deposition (geology)
 Aeolian processes 
File:MoabAlcoveJPGAeolian processes pertain to the activity of the winds and more specifically to the winds ability to shape the surface of the Earth Winds may erode transport and deposit materials and are effective agents in regions with sparse vegetation and a large supply of fine unconsolidated sediments Although water and mass flow tend to mobilize more material than wind in most environments aeolian processes are important in arid environments such as deserts

 Biological processes

 Fluvial processes 
File:Eroding Mesas Forming Seif and Barchan Dunes in Hellespontus regionjpg

Rivers and streams are not only conduits of water but also of sediment The water as it flows over the channel bed is able to mobilize sediment and transport it downstream either as bed load suspended load or dissolved load The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and on the rivers discharge (hydrology)
As rivers flow across the landscape they generally increase in size merging with other rivers The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system (geomorphology)
 Glacial processes 
File:Glacial landscape LMBpngGlaciers while geographically restricted are effective agents of landscape change The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes Abrasion (geology)
The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements particularly hillslope and fluvial processes is an important aspect of PlioPleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes This concept contrasts with periglacial processes which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost

 Hillslope processes 
File:TalusConesIsfjordenjpgImage:FergusonslidejpgSoil regolith and rock (geology)
Ongoing hillslope processes can change the topology of the hillslope surface which in turn can change the rates of those processes Hillslopes that steepen up to certain critical thresholds are capable of shedding extremely large volumes of material very quickly making hillslope processes an extremely important element of landscapes in tectonically active areas

On the Earth biological processes such as burrowing or tree throw may play important roles in setting the rates of some hillslope processes

 Igneous processes 
Both volcanic (eruptive) and plutonic (intrusive) igneous processes can have important impacts on geomorphology The action of volcanoes tends to rejuvenize landscapes covering the old land surface with lava and tephra releasing pyroclastic flow
 Tectonic processes 

Plate tectonics
Features of deeper Mantle (geology)
 Marine processes 
Marine processes are those associated with the action of waves marine currents and seepage of fluids through the seafloor Mass wasting and submarine landslide
 Overlap with other fields 
There is a considerable overlap between geomorphology and other fields Deposition of material is extremely important in sedimentology Weathering is the chemical and physical disruption of earth materials in place on exposure to atmospheric or near surface agents and is typically studied by soil science
