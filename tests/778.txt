History
One of the first allegations of mechanical doping goes back to the 2010 Tour of Flanders when Fabian Cancellara attacked Tom Boonen on a steep part of Muur van Geraardsbergen
In January 2016 – almost six years after initial allegations of a pro cyclist doping mechanically – the first confirmed use of "mechanical doping" in the sport was discovered at the 2016 UCI Cyclocross World Championships when one of the bikes of Belgian cyclist Femke Van den Driessche was found to have a secret motor inside

Some sources claim that motorized doping has occurred before in professional cycling but that it has gone undetected or unproven It is seen as part of a larger effort by athletes in many sports to gain mechanical advantage in competition In May 2010 former rider Davide Cassani demonstrated a motorised bicycle on the Italian public broadcaster RAI claiming that similar bikes had been used by some professional cyclists since 2004 The discovery of a motor resulted in a substantial uptick in the level of scrutiny focused on bikes The UCI has indicated it intends to expend Euro
One blogger described it as the worst scandal in cycling since the doping scandal that engulfed Lance Armstrong in 2012

UCI regulations
The federations technological fraud article 121013 fully states:<br/>
<blockquote>"Technological fraud is an infringement to article 13010 Technological fraud is materialised by:

"The presence within or on the margins of a cycling competition of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 13010 The use by a rider within or on the margins of a cycling competition of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 13010 All teams must ensure that all their bicycles are in compliance with the provisions of article 13010 Any presence of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 13010 within or on the margins of a cycling competition constitutes a technological fraud by the team and the rider All riders must ensure that any bicycle that they use is in compliance with the provisions of article 13010 Any use by a rider of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 13010 within or on the margins of a cycling competition constitutes a technological fraud by the team and the rider<br/>

Any technological fraud shall be sanctioned as follows:
 Rider: disqualification suspension of a minimum of six months and a fine of between CHF 20000 and CHF 200000
 Team: disqualification suspension of a minimum of six months and a fine of between CHF 100000 and CHF 1000000"</blockquote>

In pertinent part the technical regulation plainly states:
<blockquote>"The bicycle shall be propelled solely through a chainset by the legs (inferior muscular chain) moving in a circular movement without electric or other assistance"</blockquote>

Inspections
The UCI says that it has a new device which will reveal the existence of electrical circuitry armatures batteries etc which are where they are not supposed to be For the 2016 Tour de France thermal cameras were used to detect hidden motors The UCI carried out a total of 10000 bicycle checks for hidden motors and magnets in 2016 whilst at the 2017 Tour Down Under 132 tests were carried out

In March 2018 the UCI announced that Xray cameras would be used in future on Grand Tour (cycling)
