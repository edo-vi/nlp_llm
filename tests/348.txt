The USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal relates to the sexual abuse of gymnasts—primarily minors at the time of the abuse—over two decades in the United States starting in the 1990s More than 500 athletes alleged that they were sexually assaulted "by gym owners coaches and staff working for gymnastics programs across the country" including USA Gymnastics (USAG) and Michigan State University (MSU) It is considered the largest sexual abuse scandal in sports history

The abuses were first reported in September 2016 by The Indianapolis Star whose ninemonth investigation found that the abuses were widespread because "predatory coaches were allowed to move from gym to gym undetected by a lax system of oversight or dangerously passed on by USA Gymnasticscertified gyms" Coaches and officials perpetrated facilitated or worked to conceal abuse in Michigan Pennsylvania California Rhode Island Indiana and elsewhere Federal Bureau of Investigation
A central figure was Larry Nassar a nationalteam doctor for USAG and osteopathic physician in MSUs athletic department More than 265 women said Nassar had sexually abused them under the pretense of providing medical treatment including former United States womens national gymnastics team
The scandal led to the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017 which directed the creation of the US Center for SafeSport

In 2018 MSU agreed to pay $500 million to settle lawsuits accusing university leaders including its president and athletic director of enabling Nassars abuse

In 2021 the USOPC and USAG settled lawsuits brought by more than 500 athletes for $380 million

Background
Since 1990 USA Gymnastics has kept a list of people permanently banned from coaching for sexual abuse and other reasons For example the list includes Robert Dean Head a USAG coach in Kentucky who in 1992 pled guilty to raping a 12yearold and Don Peters the national coach for the Gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics
Yet USAG leaders also routinely dismissed warnings about coaches For example USAG received complaints about coach Mark Schiefelbein long before he was convicted in 2003 of molesting a 10yearold girl Similarly USAG received complaints about coach James Bell at least five years before he was jailed in 2003 for molesting three young gymnasts In a 2013 lawsuit USAG officials admitted under oath that allegations of sexual abuse were routinely dismissed as hearsay unless they came directly from a victim or victims parent

Even when USAG leaders believed the accusers they sometimes allowed coaches to continue coaching for years For example they waited four years before telling the police that they had received credible allegations of sexual assault by Marvin Sharp who became a USAG coach in 2010 Sharp was charged in 2015 with three counts of child molestation and four counts of sexual misconduct with a minor; he died by suicide in prison

At least four complaints were made against Georgia (US state)
A judge released over 5600 pages of court records in the McCabe case after Marisa Kwiatkowski from the Indianapolis Star requested the documents These documents show how USAG responded to sexual misconduct allegations made against coaches from 1996 to 2006 The released documents included a letter which says a USAG regional chair spoke to the organizations president in support of allowing a convicted sex offender to keep his membership Other documents include sexual abuse complaints that were filed against 54 coaches The documents revealed that some of these coaches were not banned from the sport even after being convicted of the crimes USAG has since said that it has banned 37 of the 54 coaches

In a deposition USAG President Steve Penny said: "To the best of my knowledge theres no duty to report if you are—if you are a thirdparty to some allegationYou know that lies with the person who has firsthand knowledge"

In 2016 Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar was arrested on charges of sex abuse and possession of child pornography Multiple victims of sexual abuse have filed lawsuits against USAG and other parties Nassar was a licensed osteopathic physician and the United States womens national gymnastics team
Sexual abuse allegations
In September 2016 The Indianapolis Star reported that Rachael Denhollander was one of two former gymnasts who had made accusations of sexual abuse against Nassar Following those criminal complaints MSU reassigned Nassar from his clinical and teaching duties and fired him later that month

According to those reports Nassar committed sexual assaults during medical examinations and purported treatments The molestations ranged from his inserting a finger into the gymnasts vaginas and anuses to fondling their breasts and genitalia These were criminal acts regardless of consent since the victims were minors Nassar initially denied the charges claiming that he was performing legitimate medical procedures Rachael Denhollander one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar

Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney using the MeToo movement
During a 60 Minutes interview Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman also accused Nassar of sexually abusing her when she was 15 years old and said she was also a victim of Nassars abuse

The following month Nassar was indicted on federal child pornography charges According to the FBI over 37000 images and videos of child pornography were seized from Nassars home including a GoPro video of Nassar allegedly molesting girls in a swimming pool Some of the material was found on a hard drive and disks that Nassar discarded in his trash bin outside his home Nassar pleaded guilty to three federal child pornography charges on July 11 2017 and was given three consecutive 20year prison sentences by US District Judge Janet T Neff on December 7 2017

More than 150 women made impact statements during Nassars weeklong sentencing hearing before the former doctor was sentenced on January 24 2018 to state prison for 40 to 175 years During his federal sentencing Judge Neff had previously ordered that any state prison term run consecutive with Nassars federal sentence Judge Aquilina quoted a letter that Nassar had sent her prior to sentencing in which he blamed his accusers She described him as a dangerous individual who showed little remorse and said that she "signed his death warrant"

MSU
MSU said that it first received a complaint against Nassar in 2014 A Title IX investigation into the complaint found no violation of policy and Nassar was allowed to continue treating patients under certain agreedupon restrictions as stipulated by MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine Dean William Strampel However no monitoring was instituted After allegations against Nassar were reported by The Indianapolis Star in September 2016 Nassar was fired by Michigan State for violating the 2014 agreement

By 2017 the university faced lawsuits from 144 local and MSU athletes who said they were sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar

MSU gymnastics coach Kathie Klages was suspended on February 13 2017 and retired the next day According to court documents Klages was reportedly aware of allegations against Nassar as early as 1997 She was accused of dismissing the complaints and pressuring gymnasts to stay silent about them

FBI failure to investigate and false statements
The FBI failed to launch formal investigations into allegations that Nassar was abusing gymnasts; when asked about this certain FBI officials lied and tried to cover up their failures according to a report released in July 2021 by the Office of the Inspector general
In 2015 USAG president Stephen Penny told local FBI agents in Indianapolis that three gymnasts said they were assaulted by Nassar The FBI did not open a formal investigation or inform federal or state authorities in Michigan In 2016 FBI agents in Los Angeles began a sexual tourism investigation against Nassar and interviewed several victims but also didnt alert Michigan authorities

Between the time the FBI was told of Nassars abuses and his arrest by MSU police in fall 2016 he abused more athletes—estimates range from at least 70 according to the DOJ IG report; and 120 according to Nassars victims

The report said that FBI agent William Jay Abbott had failed to act on the gymnasts allegations and later lied about doing so The report further alleged that USAGs Penny had discussed finding Abbott a job at USA Gymnastics while telling Abbott his concerns about the bad publicity that would be generated by the scandal

Two months after the DOD IG report was released in July 2021 gymnasts Maroney Biles Nichols and Raisman testified to the US Senate that FBI agents had mishandled their allegations against Nassar that the agents had lied about their reports and that they had spread misinformation about the botched investigation Maroney testified that she was met with silence by an FBI agent after telling the agent of Nassars "molestations in extreme detail" She said that the FBI falsified her statement and that the agents involved should be indicted; she also criticized United States Deputy Attorney General
In April and June 2022 103 victims of Nassar sued the FBI for a total of $113 billion under the Federal Tort Claims Act for the FBIs false statements and inaction In May 2022 the Department of Justice refused to arrest any FBI agent that was involved in the failure to investigate for 14 months
