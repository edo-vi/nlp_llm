"The Little Lost Child" is a popular song of 1894 by Edward B Marks and Joseph W Stern which sold more than two million copies of its sheet music following its promotion as the first ever illustrated songs
Marks was a button salesman who wrote rhymes and verse and Stern a necktie salesman who played the piano and wrote tunes  Together they formed a music publishing house called Joseph W Stern & Co and became an important part of the Tin Pan Alley sheet music publishing scene  Marks wrote the lyrics about a lost little girl found by a policeman who goes on to find the girls mother who turns out to be the policemans estranged wife; Stern wrote the music for piano and vocals  Joseph W Stern & Co "started their career in a little basement at 314 East Fourteenth Street with a 30cent sign and a $1 letterbox which to say the least was not large capital even in those days"

The promotion (marketing)
Stern retired in 1920 and his firm became the Edward B Marks Music Company which published a string of hits such as "Strange Fruit" by Abel Meeropol (and made famous by Billie Holiday) in 1939 and has been a subsidiary of Carlin America since 1980

"The Little Lost Child" was the first of several hit songs Marks and Stern wrote together as well as the first of several their company published but it became a true sensation and was wellremembered several decades later

Lyrics and sheet music

The songs composition employed a strophic form with a chorus
<poem>
First verse:
A passing policeman found a little child
She walked beside him dried her tears and smiled
Said he to her kindly "Now you must not cry
I will find your mama for you by and by"
At the station when he asked her for her name
And she answered "Jennie" it made him exclaim:
"At last of your mother I have now a trace!
Your little features bring back her sweet face"
</poem>
<poem>
Chorus:
"Do not fear my little darling and I will take you right home
Come and sit down close beside me  No more from me you shall roam
For you were a babe in arms when your mother left me one day
Left me at home deserted alone and took you my child away"
</poem>
