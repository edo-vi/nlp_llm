An edible vaccine is a food typically plants that contain vitamins proteins or other nourishment that act as a vaccine against a certain disease Once the plant fruit or plant derived product is ingested orally it stimulates the immune system Edible vaccines are genetically modified crops that contain antigens for specific diseases Edible vaccines offer many benefits over traditional vaccines due to their lower manufacturing cost and a lack of negative side effects However there are limitations as edible vaccines are still new and developing Further research will need to be done before they are ready for widespread human consumption Edible vaccines are currently being developed for measles cholera foot and mouth disease Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C

 Benefits 
Edible vaccines differ from traditional vaccines in many ways and overcome many of their limitations Traditional vaccines can be too expensive or restricted to manufacture and develop in certain countries In contrast edible vaccines are easy to produce purify sterilize and distribute Since they do not require more expensive manufacturing equipment only rich soil the cost to grow the vaccines is significantly lowered In addition edible vaccines do not require sterilized production facilities or the biosafety standards required to cultivate certain pathogenic agents for traditional vaccines which are expensive to implement and maintain They are also easier and less expensive to store since they do not require strict refrigerated storage This necessity for cold chain storage creates many issues in third world countries The seeds from an edible vaccine plant can also be easily dehydrated and preserved for cheap and quick distribution which makes them easily accessible in times of need

Edible vaccines also offer a profuse amount of potential health benefits that edible vaccines have over traditional vaccines Eating a vaccine is a simpler means of administration compared to injection making them extremely economical This reduces the need for medical personnel and sterile injection conditions that are not always achievable in developing countries Edible vaccines are considered a “pharmafood” which is a food source that increases health while also fighting diseases The benefit of using plants is that plants are efficient vectors for vaccine production Many traditional vaccines that are developed from cultured mammalian cells can lead to contamination with animal viruses However edible vaccines eliminate this issue because plant viruses cannot impact humans Moreover as a result of numerous antigens being integrated the Mcells are randomly stimulated; leading to the possibility of secondgeneration vaccines

Edible vaccines do not require subsidiary elements to stimulate an immune response like traditional vaccines Some major concerns with traditional vaccines are potential side effects for example allergic reactions Since edible vaccines lack certain toxic compounds and only contain therapeutic proteins which are free of pathogens and toxins the risk of potential side effects and allergic reactions are greatly reduced

 Limitations 
Edible vaccines also have multiple disadvantages compared to traditional vaccines Since edible vaccines are still in their infancy there are still many unknowns left to discover The adequate dosage amount and how long it lasts is still undetermined The dosage varies due to many factors including: the plant generation the individual plant the protein content the ripeness of the fruit and how much of it is eaten The dosage also varies due to the difficulty in standardizing the concentration of the antigen in the plant tissue; it can be tedious to produce both consistently and large scale The antigen concentration can also vary significantly between individual fruits on a plant individual plants and between plant generations Low doses result in the consumption of less antibodies but a high dose results in establishing an oral and immune tolerance to the vaccine proteins The logistics of controlling dosage quality and consistency still need to be determined and verified

Since it is such a new field the longterm effects are still unknown Additionally the effects and risk of using pesticides on the plants could be negative towards both the plant vaccine and the consumer There is also the risk of transgenic escape into the surrounding environment; however this could be reduced by regulating growing practices and locations Many plants are not eaten raw and the cooking could weaken or destroy the proteins in the vaccine In a study it was found that after boiling a potato for 5 minutes half of the vaccine survived thus showing that not all edible vaccines have to be ingested raw if dosages account for cooking times and temperatures There is also a concern that the gastric enzymes and the acidic environment of the stomach will break down the vaccine before it can activate an immune response Moreover concerns have arisen regarding the vaccine behavior being different due to the differing glycosylation pattern of plants and humans

 Production 
Edible vaccines are subunit vaccines; they contain a antigen proteins for a pathogen but lack the genes for the full pathogen to form The first steps in making an edible vaccine is the identification isolation and characterization of a pathogenic antigen In order to be effective the antigen needs to elicit a strong and specific immune response Once the antigen is identified and isolated the gene is cloned into a transfer vector One of the most common transfer vectors for DNA being used for edible vaccines is Agrobacterium tumefaciens The pathogen sequence is  inserted into the transfer DNA (TDNA) to produce the antigenic protein It is then inserted into the genome expressed and inherited in a mendelian fashion which results in the antigen being expressed in the fruit or plant From that point forward traditional vegetative methods and techniques are used to grow the plants and propagate the genetic line

 Techniques 
The entire gene is inserted into a plant transformation vector to allow transcription or the epitope within the antigen is identified and the DNA fragment can be used to construct genes by fusion with a coat protein gene from a plant virus Then the recombinant virus can infect other plants The epitope is first identified and then DNA fragment encoding is used to construct genes by fusion with a coat protein gene from plant virus (TMV or CMV) The transgene can be expressed either through a stable transformation system or through transient transformation system based on where the transgene has been inserted into the cell

 Stable transformation 
A stable transformation involves a nuclear or plasmid integration in which permanent changes occur in the recipient cells’ genes and the targeted transgene is integrated into the genome of host plant cells

 Transient transformation 
A transient transformation involves a plasmid/vector system using Agrobacterium tumefaciens which integrates the exogenous genes into the TDNA then infects the vegetable tissue Agrobacterium is the common technique used currently because it’s a pathogenic bacterium found in soil that naturally infects plants and transfers their genes (TDNA) to the nucleus of the plant A tumefaciens is the most preferred strain because it carries tumourinducing plasmids The genes will be made into a neutralized Tiplasmid and the heterologous gene is inserted to form a recombinant plasmid vector The vector is then turned into the desired strain with the help of the virulence genes of the bacterium It is then transferred and integrated into the genomic DNA of the host plant by nonhomologous recombination at random sites This method has a low yield and is a slow process and it is the most effective when used with dicotyledonous plants such as tomato potato and tobacco

 Bombardment method 
Another technique is the microprojectile bombardment method where selected DNA sequences are processed and penetrated into the chloroplast genome The gene containing DNA coated metal particles are fired at the plant cells using a gene gun The plants take up the DNA grow into new plants then are cloned to produce large numbers of genetically identical crops The gene transfer is independent and it can express antigens through nuclear and chloroplast transformation

 Additional methods 
There are a few other techniques that have been tested however the three techniques describe above are more common and practical One of the alternative methods is nuclear transformation This is when the desired gene is inserted into the plant nucleus through nonhomologous recombination Furthermore electroporation has been considered but it is not common because the cell wall has to be weakened before the pulses and DNA insertion can occur Lastly it is thought that molecular farming can be used so that the plants can be used as protein factories

 Immune response 
After the vaccine is orally ingested it reaches the digestive tract mucosa and stimulates the mucosal immune system These provide the firstline of defense against attacking pathogens The Mcells (found in Peyer’s patches) in the mucous membranes of the lymphatic system
 Research 
Current research has focused on a variety of different types of plants in order to determine which is the most eligible and efficient The plant has to be robust nutritious appetizing transformable and ideally domestic Some examples of crops that are being tested include: corn tomato rice carrots soybeans alfalfa papaya quinoa peas apples algae wheat lettuce potatoes bananas and tobacco; with the last four being the most common When looking at which plants are the best there are many factors that must be taken into account From the research scientists have started to pair crops with diseases They believe that edible vaccines can be made for many diseases; such as rotavirus cholera gastroenteritis autoimmune disease malaria and rabies For example they think that booster shots can be distributed through lettuce It is also essential to find foods that can be eaten raw because it is thought that cooking would denature the proteins Because of this bananas and tomatoes have become top viable options While bananas are productionally inexpensive and native in many underdeveloped nations tomatoes have the ability to preserve healing processes because they are immune to thermal process; this makes them great for HIV antigens They are an ideal crop because they contain betaamyloid Even though crops seem optimal it is also necessary to look at the byproducts For example tobacco has been found to be good for recombinant protein production it is unsuitable for vaccine production because the plant also produces toxic compounds Additionally potatoes have been a main focus for edible vaccines so much so that clinical trials using potatoes has already began

 Vaccines in development 
Presently there are edible vaccines for measles cholera foot and mouth disease and hepatitis B C & E However even though there are edible vaccines they are predominately tested in the animal testing and in development phases with some human clinical trials being conducted As mentioned above the human trials have revolved around potatoes In one cholera study adults were given transgenic potatoes with various LTB amounts in order to see how their IgA antiLT and IgA anti LT amounts changed Furthermore they are in phase II on a potato vaccine booster for hepatitis B Hepatitis B surface antigens were expressed in the potatoes and were given to already vaccinated patients It was then observed if an immune response occurred 95% of the volunteers had some form of an immune response and 625% showed an increase in antiHBsAg titers From these studies the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease has supported that edible vaccines can safely trigger an immune response however it is also known that they are far from being able to begin large scale human testing for autoimmunity and infectious diseases

 Animal testing 
Many animal testing
 Availability 
While the public awareness regarding edible vaccines is increasing they are still not available for consumer use Currently they have only developed and started testing edible vaccines for some diseases During three of the recent disease outbreaks around the world edible vaccines have been developed for testing on animals but have not reached human trials Also it has been found that a biotechnological company has started to develop a patent and are working on beginning clinical trials for a transmissible gastroenteritis virus
