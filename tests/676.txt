The need for a booster dose following a primary vaccination is evaluated in several ways One way is to measure the level of Antibody
If a patient receives a booster dose but already has a high level of antibody then a reaction called an Arthus reaction could develop a localized form of Type III hypersensitivity induced by high levels of Immunoglobulin G
It is not yet fully clear why some vaccines such as hepatitis A and B  are effective for life and some such as tetanus need boosters  The prevailing theory is that if the immune system responds to a primary vaccine rapidly the body does not have time to sufficiently develop immunological memory against the disease and memory cells will not persist in high numbers for the lifetime of the human After a primary response of the immune system against a vaccination memory T helper cells and B cells persist at a fairly constant level in germinal centers undergoing cell division at a slow to nonexistent rate While these cells are longlived  they do not typically undergo mitosis and eventually the rate of loss of these cells will be greater than the rate of gain In these cases a booster dose is required to "boost" the memory B cell
 Polio booster doses 
In the case of the polio vaccine the memory B cell
In the United States only the IPV is used In rare cases (about 1 in 27 million) the OPV has reverted to a strengthened form of the illness and caused paralysis in the recipients of the vaccine For this reason the US only administers IPV which is given in four increments (3 within their first year and a half after birth then one booster dose between the ages 4–6)

 Hepatitis B booster doses 

The need for a booster dose for hepatitis B has long been debated Studies in the early 2000s that measured memory cell count of vaccinated individuals showed that fully vaccinated adults (those that received all three rounds of vaccination at the suggested time sequence during infancy) do not require a booster dose later in life Both the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) supported these recommendations by publicly advising against the need for a hepatitis B booster dose  However immunosuppression
 Tetanus booster dose 
The tetanus disease requires a booster dose every 10 years or in some circumstances immediately following infection of tetanus Td is the name of the booster for adults and differs from the primary dose in that it does not include immunization against pertussis (whooping cough) While the US recommends a booster for tetanus every 10 years other countries such as the UK suggest just two booster shots within the first 20 years of life but no booster after a third decade Neonatal tetanus is a concern during pregnancy for some women and mothers are recommended a booster against tetanus during their pregnancy in order to protect their child against the disease

 Whooping cough booster dose 
Whooping cough also called pertussis is a contagious disease that affects the respiratory tract The infection is caused by a bacterium that sticks to the cilia of the upper respiratory tract and can be very contagious Pertussis can be especially dangerous for babies whose immune systems are not yet fully developed and can develop into pneumonia or result in the baby having trouble breathing DPT vaccine
Upon its invention in the 1950s the pertussis vaccine was wholecell (contained the entire inactivated bacterium) and could cause fever and local reactions in people who received the vaccine In the 1990s people in the US started using acellular vaccines (contained small portions of the bacterium) that had lower side effects but were also less effective at triggering an immunological memory response due to the antigen presented to the immune system being less complete This less effective but safer vaccine led to the development of the booster Tdap

 COVID19 booster dose 
 protection against severe disease remained high at 6 months after vaccination despite lower efficacy in protection from COVID19 infection An international panel of scientists affiliated with the Food and Drug Administration
Israel first rolled out booster doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID19 vaccine for atrisk populations in July 2021 In August this was expanded for the rest of the Israeli population Effectiveness against severe disease in Israel was lower among people vaccinated either in January or April than in those vaccinated in February or March During the first 3 weeks of August 2021 just after booster doses were approved and began to be deployed widely a shortterm protective effect of a third dose (relative to two doses) was suggested

In the United States the CDC rolled out booster shots to immunocompromised individuals during the summer of 2021 and originally planned to allow adults to receive a third dose of the COVID19 vaccine starting in September 2021 with individuals becoming eligible starting 8 months after their second dose (for those who received a twodose vaccine) After further data about longterm vaccine efficacy and the delta variant came to light the CDC ultimately made recipients eligible for boosters 6 months after the second shot in late October Subsequently vaccinations in the country surged

In September 2021 the UKs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended a booster shot for the over50s and atrisk groups preferably the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID19 vaccine
Russias Sputnik V COVID19 vaccine using similar technology to AstraZenecas COVID19 vaccine in November 2021 introduced a COVID19 booster called Sputnik Light which according to a study by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology has an effectiveness of 70% against the delta variant It can be combined with all other vaccines and may be more effective with mRNA vaccines than mRNA boosters

Booster shots can also be used after infections In this regard the UKs National Health Service recommends people to wait 28 days after testing positive for COVID19 before getting their booster shots Evidence shows that getting a vaccine after recovery from a COVID19 infection provides added protection to the immune system
