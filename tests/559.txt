Matchfixing


File:Kiyoseumi 2010 JanJPGDue to the hierarchical structure of the sport where top ranked wrestlers have great advantages in salary and status over lower ranked wrestlers speculation about the existence of matchfixing and isolated reports of match fixing have surfaced over the years The Japan Sumo Association (JSA) repeatedly denied any wrestlers were involved in matchfixing known as yaocho and even took publishers to court over such allegations

However in 2011 it was announced that an investigation by police had discovered cell phone text messages indicating that a number of matches had been fixed Allegedly 14 wrestlers and a few stablemasters were involved In the course of the investigation several wrestlers eventually admitted to matchfixing for money As a consequence the board of directors of the
JSA decided in an extraordinary meeting to cancel the March 2011 tournament in Osaka the first time this had happened since 1946 In all fourteen wrestlers were judged guilty of matchfixing to which most of them admitted involvement All of the wrestlers judged to be involved were forced to retire

The JSAs investigative panel stated in May 2011 that matchfixing appears to have been widespread The panel stated that it would be difficult to discover however the full extent of the problem The May 2011 tournament went ahead but with no sponsorship live TV coverage or trophy presentations and was referred to as the "Technical Examination Tournament" with free admission to spectators

One wrestler charged with matchfixing Sōkokurai strenuously denied any involvement and won a court case in early 2013 deeming his dismissal groundless He was subsequently reinstated by the JSA and appeared in the July 2013 tournament in the top division

Gambling and yakuza ties
On July 4 2010 the Japan Sumo Association announced its decision to dismiss the MakuuchiŌzeki
Three months before Hanaregomas announcement Japans largest yakuza group Yamaguchigumi bought fifty prized seats during a tournament so that gangsters were prominently visible during the national broadcast of the match According to experts this was an endeavor to cheer up an incarcerated boss

Hazing and violence
Tokitsukaze hazing scandal


It has been wellknown and accepted for many years that sumo stables engage in the systematic hazing and physical punishment of young disciples in order to "toughen them up" Stable masters have often been proud to show to the media how they frequently use a shinai to beat those who fall out of line and elder wrestlers are often put in charge of bullying younger ones to keep them in line for instance by making them hold heavy objects for long periods of time
However this system of hazing was widely criticized in late 2007 when a hazing scandal came to light in which a 17yearold sumo trainee named Takashi Saito from the Tokitsukaze stable died after a serious bullying incident involving his stablemaster Futatsuryū Junichi
Other scandals
Violent affairs also came to light in 2017 when Sports Nippon reported that yokozuna Harumafuji had assaulted another wrestler (Takanoiwa Yoshimori
However hazing and violence has not disappeared from professional sumo and in December 2022 Asahifuji Seiya
In March 2023 a former lowerranked wrestler in Sadogatake stable Daisuke Yanagihara sued the Japan Sumo Association and his former stablemaster Sadogatake (exKotonowaka Terumasa
In May 2023 Michinoku stable was also the subject of a controversy because a senior wrestler Kirinofuji assaulted another young wrestler Yasunishi with a frying pan and whipped him with a jump rope Stablemaster Kirishima Kazuhiro
Harassment claims and failed properly paid overtime
In October 2023 it was revealed that several employees of the Japan Sumo Association had lodged complaints with the Board of Directors about the supervision of certain nontoshiyori
Health effects
The sumo lifestyle has negative health effects which become apparent later in life Sumo wrestlers have a life expectancy between 60 and 65 more than 20 years shorter than the average Japanese male as the diet and sport take a toll on the wrestlers body Many develop type 2 diabetes or Hypertension
Women and sumo

Professional sumo excludes women from competition and ceremonies Women are not allowed to enter or touch the sumo wrestling ring (dohyō) a tradition stemming from Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that women are "impure" because of menstrual blood

The female Governor of Osaka from 2000–2008 Fusae Ohta when called upon to present the Governors Prize to the champion of the annual Osaka tournament was required to do so on the walkway beside the ring or send a male representative in her place She repeatedly challenged the JSAs policy by requesting to be allowed to fulfill her traditional role as Governor Her requests were repeatedly rejected until the end of her fiveyear term

In April 2018 during a nontournament sumo event in Kyoto Prefecture two women rushed to the aid of the mayor of Maizuru when he collapsed in the middle of the dohyō While the women were attempting to provide emergency treatment a referee repeatedly asked them to leave the ring The chairman of the Sumo Association later apologized for what he called an inappropriate response saying that he greatly appreciated the womens efforts

The view of those who criticize this continuing "menonly" policy is that it is discriminatory and oppressive
In general women in the sumo world are only expected to be supportive wives of the wrestlers and in the case that their husband has become a stablemaster a surrogate mother for all of his trainee wrestlers
The view of the JSA is that this is a tradition that has been firmly maintained through the centuries so it would be a dishonor to all of their ancestors to change it

This was not always the case Starting as early as the 18th century a form of  was performed in some areas of Japan In the cities it was more of a spectacle often associated with brothels However in some areas of Japan female sumo had a serious role in certain Shinto rituals In later years there were limited tours of female sumo that lasted for a time However female sumo is not considered to be authentic by most Japanese and is now prohibited from taking place beyond amateur settings
