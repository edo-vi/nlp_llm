In science fiction hyperspace (also known as nulspace subspace overspace jumpspace and similar terms) is a concept relating to dimensionAdditional dimensions
One of the main reasons for the concepts popularity is the impossibility of fasterthanlight travel in ordinary space which hyperspace allows writers to bypass In most works hyperspace is described as a higher dimension through which the shape of our threedimensional space can be distorted to bring distant points close to each other similar to the concept of a wormhole; or a shortcutenabling Parallel universes in fiction
The term occasionally appears in scientific works in related contexts

 Concept 
File:Wrinkled paperjpgThe basic premise of hyperspace is that vast distances through space can be traversed quickly by taking a kind of shortcut There are two common models used to explain this shortcut: folding and mapping In the folding model hyperspace is a place of higher dimension through which the shape of our threedimensional space can be distorted to bring distant points close to each other; a common analogy popularized by Robert A Heinleins Starman Jones (1953) is that of crumpling twodimensional paper or cloth in the third dimension thus bringing points on its surface into contact In the mapping model hyperspace is a Parallel universes in fiction
Hyperspace is generally seen as a fictional concept incompatible with our presentday understanding of the universe (in particular the theory of relativity

 Terminology 
The term "hyperspace" originated in 19thcentury mathematical texts in the context of higherdimensional space The means of accessing hyperspace is often called a "hyperdrive" and navigating hyperspace is typically referred to as "jumping" (as in "the ship will now jump through hyperspace")

A number of related terms (such as imaginary space Jarnell intersplit jumpspace megaflow NSpace nulspace slipstream overspace Qspace subspace and tauspace) have been used by various writers although none have gained recognition to rival that of hyperspace Some works use multiple synonyms; for example in the Star Trek franchise the term hyperspace itself is only used briefly in a single 1988 episode ("Coming of Age (Star Trek: The Next Generation)
 History 
File:Amazing stories quarterly 1931sprjpgEmerging in the early 20th century within several decades hyperspace became a common element of Interstellar travel
Another early work featuring hyperspace was Nelson Bonds The Scientific Pioneer Returns (1940) In Foundation (Asimov novel)
In 1963 Philip Harbottle called the concept of hyperspace "a fixture" of the science fiction genre and in 1977 Brian Ash (bibliographer)
In the 1974 film Dark Star (film)
 Characteristics <!Section title used as anchor for Redirect Underspace: please amend there if altering>

Hyperspace is typically described as chaotic and confusing to human senses; often at least unpleasant – transitions to or from hyperspace can cause symptoms such as nausea for example – and in some cases even hypnotic or dangerous to ones sanity Visually hyperspace is often left to the readers imagination or depicted as "a swirling gray mist" In some works it is dark Exceptions exist; for example John Russell Fearn
Many stories feature hyperspace as a dangerous treacherous place where straying from a preset course can be disastrous In Frederick Pohls The Mapmakers (novel)
While generally associated with science fiction hyperspacelike concepts exist in some works of fantasy particularly ones which involve movement between different worlds or dimensions Such travel usually done through portals rather than vehicles is usually explained through the existence of Magic (supernatural)
 Use 
While mainly designed as means of fast space travel occasionally some writers have used the hyperspace concept in more imaginative ways or as a central element of the story In Robert A Heinleins Glory Road (1963) and Robert Silverbergs "Nightwings (novella)
In many stories a starship cannot enter or leave hyperspace too close to a large concentration of mass such as a planet or star; this means that hyperspace can only be used after a starship gets to the outside Planetary system
