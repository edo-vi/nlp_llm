 Overview 
File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kickoff ceremonyjpgInternationally sportswashing has been described as part of a countrys soft power The first usage of the term "sportswashing" may have been applied to Azerbaijan and its hosting of the 2015 European Games in Baku 

People from countries accused of sportswashing often argue that they simply want to enjoy sporting events in their home countries and that sporting boycotts and event relocation are both unfair to sporting fans and are ineffective in changing government policy The 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia has been cited as an example to tackle the countrys global reputation which was low due to its foreign policy and the sporting event changed the focus of discussions to the success of the World Cup

Companies have also been accused of sportswashing include Ineos sponsorship of professional cyclings Team Sky (now the Ineos Grenadiers) in 2019 and Arabtec Holding PJSC
Sportswashing is often very costly For example in March 2021 human rights organization Grant Liberty said that Saudi Arabia alone has spent at least $15&nbsp;billion on alleged sportswashing activities
