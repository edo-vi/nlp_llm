The United States Cochrane Center (USCC) was one of the 14 centers on the world that facilitated the work of the Cochrane Collaboration
The USCC was the reference center for all 50 US states and US territories protectorates and districts: the District of Columbia American Samoa Guam the Northern Mariana Islands Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands The USCC was also the reference Center for the following countries: Antigua and Barbuda Bahamas Barbados Belize Dominica Grenada Guam Guyana Jamaica Japan Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago The USCC discontinued on February 7 2018

Historical overview

In the United States there have been four Cochrane Centers since the start of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 1993  The Baltimore Cochrane Center was launched soon after the launch of the Collaboration officially in 1994 with Kay Dickersin as Director  The San Francisco Cochrane Center was launched soon thereafter in 1996 with Lisa Bero and Drummond Rennie as CoDirectors The San Antonio Cochrane Center launched in 1994 with Cynthia Mulrow as Director and the New England Cochrane Center launched in 1996 with Joseph Lau and Alexia AnczackBouckoms as coDirectors In 1998 Kay Dickersin moved to Brown University in Providence Rhode Island and with the move the Baltimore Cochrane Center was renamed the New England Cochrane Center Providence Office

The US centers had variable luck with obtaining sufficient infrastructure funding and The San Antonio Cochrane Center closed in 2000 In December 2002 the remaining three centers (the New England Cochrane Center at Boston the New England Cochrane Center at Providence and the San Francisco Cochrane Center) merged to form a single registered entity with three offices the US Cochrane Center (the USCC)  The Providence office became the first point of contact for the work of The Cochrane Collaboration in the United States and assumed responsibility for fulfilling the core Center functions

In 2005 Kay Dickersin returned to Baltimore to take up a post at Johns Hopkins University and the USCC moved with her The New England Cochrane Center Boston Office closed in February 2008 In approximately 2006 Drummond Rennie moved out of the area leaving his post as SF Branch Director and Lisa Bero became the Center Director

In June 2014 the San Francisco Branch of the United States (US) Cochrane Center changed its name to the West Coast Branch of the US Cochrane Center and because of Lisa Bero’s emigration to Australia a new Branch Director was announced Mark Helfand located at Oregon Health and Science University

On February 7 2018 the USCC closed its doors

Main Tasks
 Supporting Cochrane entities with a coordinating base in the US or one of the countries serviced by the Center These include: Review Groups Fields and Methods Groups
 Supporting new Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs) Fields and Methods Groups who want to register with the Collaboration
 Supporting individuals who seek information about and participation in the work of the Collaboration

Offices

The USCC Main Office in Baltimore
The USCC main office in Baltimore was responsible for providing training and support for review authors trials search coordinators (TSCs) review group coordinators (RGCs) editors handsearchers consumers healthcare providers policy makers and others In addition the main office of the USCC worked with international colleagues to provide training and support for others in the Collaboration who were responsible for training

CENTRAL
Each Cochrane Center is responsible for a unique function within the Cochrane Collaboration  For twelve years (1994 to 2005) the Baltimore Cochrane Center and subsequently NECC@P was responsible for coordinating CENTRAL The Cochrane Collaboration’s central register of controlled clinical trials CENTRAL was designed for use by members of the Collaboration’s review groups and others performing systematic reviews CENTRAL serves both as a repository for trial reports identified by members of the Collaboration and as a source of trial reports from which Review Groups build their specialized registers In late 1992 work began on development of a register of reports of controlled trials for use in conducting systematic reviews The first meeting was held and the eligibility criteria were decided at the Cochrane Workshop on “Building a Register of RCTs” at Green College OxfordGreen College
Although the individuals interested in and key to the developments leading to international registers of randomized controlled trials were also leaders in the Cochrane Collaboration a larger and more centralized group was felt to be a better location for a common resource Accordingly the National Institutes of Health
The USCC conducted the “MEDLINE Retagging Project” from 19942005 by submitting to MEDLINE all CCTs and RCTs it had identified that were not yet tagged RCT/PT or CCT/PT in MEDLINE and (2) identifying all CCTs and RCTs not already identified as such on MEDLINE using electronic search methods  CENTRAL was then created using two sources of information about published trial reports periodic download of all records in MEDLINE tagged as RCT
After 1994 when the new publication type tags were initiated reports of trials missed by NLM’s MEDLINE indexing grew smaller with each year and the NLM decided not to fund the retagging Program after 2005 For the 19942005 time period CENTRAL was funded mainly by the National Library of Medicine and also by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention David and Lucile Packard Foundation
Some trials are still missed by the MEDLINE indexers however and searches of other electronic bibliographic databases are required so the effort to make CENTRAL a comprehensive database of studies possibly eligible for Cochrane reviews continues Since 2005 development of CENTRAL has been conducted by Cochrane and John Wiley and Sons publishers of The Cochrane Library

Cochrane US  West
The Cochrane US  West Center operates out of Oregon Health & Science University and University of California San Francisco It develops guidance for systematic reviews of complex interventions and realist reviews of health policies supports the production of highquality reviews and shares them with stakeholders on the west coast of the US to improve health decision making The partnership is led by Director JeanneMarie Guise MD MPH at OHSU and Associate Director Dorie Apollonio PhD MPP at UCSF It is affiliated with the Pacific Northwest Evidencebased Practice Center VA Portland Health Care System Evidence Synthesis Program and Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research Northwest the Review Groups Cochrane Back and Neck Group and Cochrane Fertility Regulation Group and with Oregon Health Authority and Oregons Health Evidence Review Commission Cochrane US  West works with the Wiki Education Foundation and students at the UCSF UCSF School of Pharmacy
The Caribbean Branch of the USCC (CBUSCC)
The CBUSCC is the reference center for Englishspeaking Caribbean territories Its development extends the services available to Cochrane contributors already working in the Caribbean region and also supports new authors

Review Groups
Current
Eyes and Vision Review Group (US Satellite) – Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health  Systematic reviews of all the interventions use to prevent or treat eye diseases and/or visual impairment We also consider the evidence for interventions that aim to help people adjust to visual impairment or blindness We have a strategy for prioritization that emphasizes major causes of blindness in the world and areas where there are wide variations in clinical practice and outcomes
Cochrane Fertility Regulation  Oregon Health and Science University  Systematic reviews of fertility issues such as contraception and unwanted pregnancy
Neonatal Review Group – Burlington Vermont  Evidencebased regularly updated reviews of the effects of therapies in neonatalperinatal medicine
Cochrane Urology – Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System
Former
Heart Review Group (US Satellite) – Feinberg School of MedicineHIV/AIDS Group (US Satellite)  (19992015)

Fields
Complementary Medicine Field
Justice Health Field

Methods Groups
Comparing Multiple Interventions Methods Group – Focuses on methodology for comparing multiple interventions in Cochrane Intervention Reviews or Overviews Cochrane Overviews aim to summarize the findings of multiple standard Cochrane reviews Brings together expertise in network metaanalysis
Patient Reported Outcomes Methods Group – Advise Cochrane reviewers about when and how to incorporate patient reported outcomes into systematic reviews Also seeks to refine methods of literature search refine methods for metaanalysis develop methods for systematically reviewing patient reported outcomes studies
