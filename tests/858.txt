The 2017–2018 United States flu season lasted from late 2017 through early 2018 The predominant strain of influenza was Influenza A virus subtype H3N2
In all states except Hawaii and Oregon the distribution of influenza was indicated as widespread including 32 states that had high flu activity The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Effects
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began counting the 2017–2018 "flu season" as October 2017 and by early February 2018 the epidemic was still widespread and increasing overall By February 2018 the CDC said that the circulating virus strains included both B strains (Yamagata and Victoria) Influenza A virus subtype H1N1
The 2017–2018 flu season was severe for all US populations and resulted in an estimated 41 million cases 710000 hospitalizations and 52000 deaths This is the highest number of illnesses since the 2009 flu season when there were an estimated 60 million cases A preliminary estimate (September 2018) attributed more than 80000 US deaths to influenza this season but this was later revised down to 52000 in light of more complete information While 186 pediatric deaths were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

 New York 
On 10 February 2018 officials in New York City confirmed the third pediatric flu death for the 2017–2018 season The week prior 43 states reported high patient traffic for the flu with flu remaining widespread in each state except Hawaii and Oregon

California
California was hit especially hard In California as of 6 January 2018 twentyseven people under the age of 65 died from flu since October nine times as many as the prior year The Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center emergency room which often caters to about 140 patients daily had more than 200 patients on one of those days By 19 January seventyfour people under the age of 65 had died in California with thirtytwo of those deaths occurring in the preceding week making it the deadliest week of the flu season so far

By 9 February 2018 the national rate for flulike symptoms for patients visiting clinics had reached "well above" seven percent a rate last seen during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009  According to the Los Angeles Times 163 people under the age of 65 had died of the flu since October 2017 compared to 40 deaths during the same time period the previous year  Of those 163 deaths 36 had died during the first week of February; the same article also noted that the peak of the flu season has apparently passed as reports of new cases have declined

Washington state
On 11 February 2018 the Seattle Times reported that "things were improving" in Washington (state)
Delaware
On 12 February 2018 Delaware announced that it had seen six deaths and 995 confirmed flu cases in seven days making it the states highest weekly total on record

Minnesota
On 11 February 2018 United States Senator Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota announced a new bill called the Flu Vaccine Act calling for further research on a better vaccine at the US National Institutes of Health At the time there had been 400 outbreaks of flu that season in Minnesotas schools and 130 outbreaks in longterm care facilities with one child in the state dying Additionally Klobuchar continued to push the US Food and Drug Administration to fix the national IV bag and saline shortage for adversely affecting the treatment of flu symptoms

 Alabama 
On 11 January 2018 Alabama governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency due to the states "overwhelmed" health care facilities potentially affecting their ability to care for patients "in the traditional normal and customary manner"

Analysis
According to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions influenza branch in January 2018 it was the first flu season where "weve had the entire continental US" show the same "widespread" flu activity excluding the District of Columbia and Hawaii Twentysix of those states were classified by the CDC as having "high" activity in January 2018

In January 2018 analyzing the reason for the spike The Atlantic noted that the flu season was possibly worse because the dominant circulating strain was the H3N2 strain which for unknown reasons tends to hit humans harder than other strains and result in worse flu seasons when dominant Also the H3N2 strain according to the CDC affects elderly and young children more than other strains resulting in more severe hospitalizations and deaths 
 
The Atlantic also noted that the 2017 vaccine for the flu was only ten percent effective against H3N2 in Australia As the typical practice of studying and creating the current vaccines in chicken eggs tends to result in mutations 2017 was the first year that researchers used dog cells rather than chicken eggs to create the H3N2 component of the vaccine Flucelvax However due to cost most Americans did not get Flucelvax in 2017 and 2018 and likely received vaccines grown with chicken eggs The Atlantic noted that the vaccine still protected against other strains such as the H1N1 and B virus and did provide at least some immunity to H3N2

In January 2018 The Atlantic also noted that the severity of the flu season in the United States may have been increased by a shortage of Intravenous therapy
