Equine nasal cysts are abnormal fluid filled sacs which occur inside the nasal sinuses of horses The cysts are lined with epithelium and usually occur in the ventral conchae or maxillary sinuses  Surgical removal of the cyst has a good prognosis for the horse

Characteristics
The most common sign of a nasal cyst is facial swelling with obstruction of the nasal passage If the cyst is located in the caudal maxillary sinus it may cause the eyeball on the affected side to bulge out of the orbit known as exophthalmos

Diagnosis
Xray
Treatment
Cysts are removed by surgery which may be performed with the horse standing and sedated or under general anesthesia Treatment involves surgical removal of the cyst and any of the involved lining of the concha

Prognosis
The prognosis for a complete recovery is good and the rate of any recurrence is minimal Some horses may have a mild mucous discharge after surgery which can be permanent

Epidemiology
Most nasal cysts are identified in horses younger than one year old but can also be diagnosed in horses over 9 years of age There is no known breed or sex predisposition for nasal cysts
