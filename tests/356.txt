A film adaptation is the transfer of a work or story in whole or in part to a feature film Although often considered a type of derivative work film adaptation has been conceptualized recently by academic scholars such as Robert Stam as a dialogic process

While the most common form of film adaptation is the use of a novel as the basis other works adapted into films include nonfiction (including journalism) autobiographical works comic books scriptures plays historical sources and even other films Adaptation from such diverse resources has been a ubiquitous practice of filmmaking since the earliest days of cinema in nineteenthcentury Europe In contrast to when making a remake movie directors usually take more creative liberties when creating a film adaptation

Elision and interpolation

In 1924 Erich von Stroheim attempted a literal adaptation of Frank Norriss novel McTeague with his film Greed (1924 film)
In some cases film adaptations also interpolate scenes or invent characters This is especially true when a novel is part of a literary saga Incidents or quotations from later or earlier novels will be inserted into a single film Additionally and far more controversially filmmakers will invent new characters or create stories that were not present in the source material at all Given the anticipated audience for a film the screenwriter director or movie studio may wish to increase character time or to invent new characters For example William J Kennedys Pulitzer Prizewinning novel Ironweed (novel)
Interpretation as adaptation

There have been several notable cases of massive inventive adaptation including the Roland Joffe adaptation of The Scarlet Letter with explicit sex between Hester Prynn and the minister and Native American obscene puns into a major character and the films villain The Charlie Kaufman and "Donald Kaufman" penned Adaptation (film)
Change is essential and practically unavoidable mandated both by the constraints of time and medium but how much is always a balance Some film theorists have argued that a director should be entirely unconcerned with the source as a novel is a novel and a film is a film and the two works of art must be seen as separate entities Since a transcription of a novel into film is impossible even holding up a goal of "accuracy" is absurd Others argue that what a film adaptation does is change to fit (literally adapt) and the film must be accurate to the effect (aesthetics) the theme or the message of a novel and that the filmmaker must introduce changes if necessary to fit the demands of time and to maximize faithfulness along one of those axes

In most cases adaptation the films are required to create identities (for example a characters costume or set decor) since they are not specified in the original material Then the influence of filmmakers may go unrecognized because there is no comparison in the original material even though the new visual identities will affect narrative interpretation Peter Jacksons adaptations of The Lord of the Rings (film series)
An often overlooked aspect of film adaptation is the inclusion of sound and music In a literary text a specific sound effect can often be implied or specified by an event but in the process of adaptation filmmakers must determine specific the sound characteristics that subliminally affects narrative interpretation In some cases of adaptation music may have been specified in the original material (usually Diegesis
In the 2016 scifi film 2BR02B: To Be or Naught to Be adapted from the story by Kurt Vonnegut the filmmakers decided to abandon Vonneguts choice of music They stated that they felt that it worked in his prose only because it was not actually heard Filmmakers test screenings found that Vonneguts style of music confused audiences and detracted from narrative comprehension The films composer Leon Coward stated "You can try to be as true to Vonneguts material as possible but at the end of the day also you’re working with the material that you as a team have generated not just Vonneguts and that’s what youve got to make work"

Theatrical adaptation

Stage plays are frequent sources for film adaptations

Many of William Shakespeares plays including Hamlet Romeo and Juliet and Othello have been adapted into films  The first sound adaptation of any Shakespeare play was the The Taming of the Shrew (1929 film)
Film adaptations of Shakespeares works in languages other than English are numerous including Akira Kurosawas films Throne of Blood (1957 an epic film version of Macbeth)  The Bad Sleep Well (1960 inspired by Hamlet) and Ran (1985 based on King Lear); and Vishal Bhardwajs  "Shakespearean trilogy" consisting of  Haider (film)
Another way in which Shakespearean texts have been incorporated in films is to feature characters who are either actors performing those texts or characters who are somehow influenced or effected by seeing one of Shakespeares plays within a larger nonShakespearean story  Generally Shakespeares basic themes or certain elements of the plot will parallel the main plot of the film or become part of a characters development in some way  Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are the two plays which have most often been used in this way Éric Rohmers 1992 film Conte dhiver (A Tale of Winter) is one example  Rohmer uses one scene from Shakepeares A Winters Tale as a major plot device within a story that is not based on the play at all

In Britain where stage plays tend to be more popular as a form of entertainment than currently in the United States many films began as a stage productions  Some British films and British/American collaborations that were based on successful British plays include Gaslight (1940 film)
Similarly hit Broadway plays are often adapted into films whether from musicals or dramas Some examples of American film adaptations based on successful Broadway plays are Arsenic and Old Lace (film)
On one hand theatrical adaptation does not involve as many interpolations or elisions as novel adaptation but on the other the demands of scenery and possibilities of motion frequently entail changes from one medium to the other Film critics will often mention if an adapted play has a static camera or emulates a proscenium arch Laurence Olivier consciously imitated the arch with his Henry V (1944) having the camera begin to move and to use color stock after the prologue indicating the passage from physical to imaginative space Sometimes the adaptive process can continue after one translation Mel Brooks The Producers began as a film in 1967 was adapted into a Broadway musical in 2001 and then adapted again in 2005 as a musical film

Television adaptation
Feature films are occasionally created from television series or television segments or vice versa a television series will derive from a film such as in the case of Bates Motel (TV series)
At the same time some theatrically released films are adaptations of television miniseries events When national film boards and statecontrolled television networks coexist filmmakers can sometimes create very long films for television that they may adapt solely for time for theatrical release Both Ingmar Bergman (notably with Fanny and Alexander but with other films as well) and Lars von Trier have created long television films that they then recut for international distribution

Even segments of television series have been adapted into feature films The American television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live has been the origin of a number of films beginning with The Blues Brothers (film)
Radio adaptation
Radio narratives have also provided the basis of film adaptation In the heyday of radio radio segments were often translated to film usually as shorts Radio series turned into film series include Dr Christian Crime Doctor (radio program)
Comic book adaptation

American comic book characters particularly superheroes have long been adapted into film beginning in the 1940s with Saturday movie serials aimed at children Superman (1978 film)
The adaptation process for comics is different from that of novels Many successful comic book series last for several decades and have featured several variations of the characters in that time Films based on such series usually try to capture the back story and “spirit” of the character instead of adapting a particular storyline Occasionally aspects of the characters and their origins are simplified or modernized

Selfcontained graphic novels and miniseries many of which do not feature superheroes can be adapted more directly such as in the case of Road to Perdition (2002) or V for Vendetta (film)
Furthermore some films based on longrunning franchises use particular story lines from the franchise as a basis for a plot The X2 (film)
The Marvel Cinematic Universe starting in 2008 is a shared universe with films combining characters from different works by Marvel Comics The DC Extended Universe starting in 2013 uses the same model for DC Comics

The List of highestgrossing films
Video game adaptation

Tiein video games with films or other properties have existed since home consoles and arcade games of the early 1980s Developers are usually limited by what they can do with the film property and may be further limited in time as to produce the game in time for the release of the film or other work

Video games have also been adapted into films beginning in the early 1980s Films closely related to the computer and video game industries were also done in this time such as Tron and Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)
Similar to comic bookbased films in the past (especially from 1980s) films based on video games tend to carry a reputation of lackluster quality and receive negative reaction from both film critics and fans of the source material Some such as Super Mario Bros were particularly negatively received and are considered among the List of films considered the worst
Another likely reason for the failure of video game adaptations is that structural conversion from video game to film format can be challenging for filmmakers Shigeru Miyamoto creator of Nintendo franchises including Mario (franchise)

In an interview with Fortune (magazine)
Until 2019 no video game film – liveaction or animated – had received a Rotten Tomatoes "fresh" rating with a score over 60% Three films since Detective Pikachu (film)
Following these films new adaptions of games into films and television series became successful and showed that adaptions that held to a games story but did not try to maintain the video game aspects were more popular with audiences Shows such as Arcane (TV series)
Though video game films are critically panned they tend to do well from the international take at box offices Warcraft (film)
Among the most wellknown video game filmmakers is Uwe Boll a German writer director and producer whose works include House of the Dead (film)
Adaptations from other sources

While documentary films have often been made from journalism and reportage so too have some dramatic films including: All the Presidents Men (1976 adapted from the 1974 book); Miracle (2004 from an account published shortly after the 1980 "miracle on ice"); and Pushing Tin (1999 from a 1996 New York Times article by Darcy Frey) An Inconvenient Truth is Al Gores film adaptation of his own Keynote multimedia presentation The 2011 independent comedy film Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins was based on Kermode and Mayos Film Review of Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief

Films adapted from songs include Coward of the County Ode to Billy Joe Convoy and Pretty Baby (each from a song of the same name)

Films based on toys include the Transformers franchise and the GI Joe films; there is a longer history of animated television series being created simultaneous to toy lines as a marketing tool Hasbros plans to for films based on their board games began with 2012s Battleship While amusement park rides have often been based on action movies conversely the 1967 Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland was adapted into Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in 2003

Remakes and film sequels are technically adaptations of the original film Less direct derivations include The Magnificent Seven from The Seven Samurai Star Wars from The Hidden Fortress and 12 Monkeys from La Jetée

Many films have been made from mythology and religious texts Both Greek mythology and the Bible have been adapted frequently Homers works have been adapted multiple times in several nations  In these cases the audience already knows the story well and so the adaptation will deemphasize elements of suspense and concentrate instead on detail and phrasing

Awards
Many major film award programs present an award for adapted screenplays separate from the award for original screenplays

In the case of a film which was adapted from an unpublished work however different awards have different rules around which category the screenplay qualifies for In 1983 the Canadian Genie Awards rescinded the Best Adapted Screenplay award they had presented to the film Melanie (film)
Adaptation of films
When a films screenplay is original it can also be the source of derivative works such as novels and plays For example movie studios will commission novelizations of their popular titles or sell the rights to their titles to publishing houses These novelized films will frequently be written on assignment and sometimes written by authors who have only an early script as their source Consequently novelizations are quite often changed from the films as they appear in theatres

Novelization can build up characters and incidents for commercial reasons (eg to market a card or computer game to promote the publishers "saga" of novels or to create continuity between films in a series)

There have been instances of novelists who have worked from their own screenplays to create novels at nearly the same time as a film Both Arthur C Clarke with 2001: A Space Odyssey and Graham Greene with The Third Man have worked from their own film ideas to a novel form (although the novel version of The Third Man was written more to aid in the development of the screenplay than for the purposes of being released as a novel) Both John Sayles and Ingmar Bergman write their film ideas as novels before they begin producing them as films although neither director has allowed these prose treatments to be published

Finally films have inspired and been adapted into plays John Waterss films have been successfully mounted as plays; both Hairspray (1988 film)
