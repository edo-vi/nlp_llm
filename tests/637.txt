Synthetic intelligence (SI) is an alternative/opposite term for artificial intelligence emphasizing that the intelligence of machines need not be an imitation or in any way artificial; it can be a genuine form of intelligence John Haugeland proposes an analogy with diamond simulant
Definition
The term was used<! did he coin it? > by Haugeland in 1986 to describe artificial intelligence research up to that point which he called "GOFAI
The term "synthetic AI" is now sometimes used by researchers in the field to separate their work (using Subsymbolic
Sources disagree about exactly what constitutes "real" intelligence as opposed to "simulated" intelligence and therefore whether there is a meaningful distinction between artificial intelligence and synthetic intelligence Russell and Norvig present this example:
 "Can machines fly?" The answer is yes because airplanes fly
 "Can machines swim?" The answer is no because submarines dont swim
 "Can machines think?" Is this question like the first or like the second?

Drew McDermott firmly believes that "thinking" should be construed like "flying" While discussing the electronic chess champion Deep Blue (chess computer)
John Searle on the other hand suggests that a thinking machine is at best a simulation and writes "No one supposes that computer simulations of a fivealarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched" The essential difference between a simulated mind and a real mind is one of the key points of his Chinese room argument

Daniel Dennett believes that this is basically a disagreement about semantics peripheral to the central questions of the philosophy of artificial intelligence He notes that even a chemically perfect imitation of a Chateau Latour is still a fake but that any vodka is real no matter who made it Similarly a perfect moleculebymolecule recreation of an original Picasso would be considered a "forgery" but any image of the CocaCola
