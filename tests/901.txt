The sprouts of capitalism seeds of capitalism or capitalist sprouts are features of the economy of the late Ming dynasty
Origins of the idea
File:Mao1939jpgThe Chinese term was first used in the first chapter "Chinese Society" of The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party edited by Mao Zedong in 1939:
 herself have developed slowly into a capitalist society even without the impact of foreign capitalismSimilar ideas had been explored by Chinese Marxists in the 1920s and 1930s and provided a way of reconciling Chinese history with Karl Marxs five stages of modes of production: primitive slavery feudal capitalist and socialist

Shang Yue and other Chinese historians sought to justify Maos hypothesis in the 1950s producing a series of papers collected in two volumes entitled Essays on the debate on the sprouts of capitalism in China published in 1957 and 1960
They identified a number of developments in the Chinese economy between the 16th and 18th centuries including improved farming and handicraft technologies improvement and expansion of markets and changes in wage labor relationships
These developments were compared to earlier changes in European economies and held to constitute a new protocapitalist phase of Chinese economic history
Some versions of the theory held that indigenous development of industrial capitalism was forestalled by the 17thcentury Manchu invasion or 19thcentury conflicts with European powers such as the Opium War
while others believed that the sprouts were always weak and had withered by the 19th century

Later history of the idea

These ideas were also explored by Japanese historians of China in the 1950s though they concluded that a decisive transformation was unlikely
In 1980 the lateMing historian Mori Masao said this work "failed to produce satisfactory theoretical results though it uncovered a wealth of historical facts which had hitherto been unknown"
Western economic historians have tended to dismiss the suggestion that these developments presaged a capitalist transformation

In China Shang Yue and the "sprouts" theories were denounced in the Antirightist Movement and Cultural Revolution for their emphasis on capitalism and for contradicting Maos emphasis on Chinese reaction to Western imperialism in the 19th century
The fall of the Gang of Four in 1976 and the Chinese economic reformA notable contribution was the 3volume A History of the Development of Capitalism in China by Wu Chengming and colleagues in 1985 with the second volume dealing with the sprouts of capitalism
There have been few publications in the area since the early 1990s
Wu Chengming himself abandoned the idea in the late 1990s
Many Chinese historians now accept that the "sprouts" did not amount to a decisive new phase of economic development

Economists such as Philip Huang and Li Bozhong have attacked "sprouts" research and other approaches measuring Chinese economic history against developments in Western Europe They challenge the underlying assumption of a single path of development reflected by the European experience and argue that focusing on similarities with Europe distorts the study of Chinese history

 Parallels identified in the sprouts literature 
File:Du Halde  Description de la Chine  Vol 2 feuille 272jpgThe sprouts researchers tended to identify the expansion of markets with capitalism
In an influential study in 1957 Fu Yiling placed the origin of the sprouts in a 16thcentury "commercial revolution"
Chinese exports to the West generated an inflow of silver from the Americas which expanded the money supply driving the monetization of markets and taxation
The following centuries saw increased regional specialization and the
integration of rural markets

Researchers have pointed to the rise of wage labour in late Ming and early Qing workshops in textile paper and other industries
However they lacked the production accounting methods found in European factories achieving largescale production by using many small workshops each with a small team of workers under a master craftsman

The organization of silk weaving in 18thcentury Chinese cities was compared with the puttingout system used in European textile industries between the 13th and 18th centuries
As the interregional silk trade grew merchant houses began to organize manufacture to guarantee their supplies providing silk to households for weaving as piece work
In contrast to Europe where puttingout aimed to harness rural labour to bypass the urban guild system the Chinese system was a mechanism of spreading risk
In addition although puttingout began much earlier in continental Europe it was only in the English cotton industry that it led to industrialization

 Korean historiography 

Korean nationalist historians advanced a "sprouts" theory as a counter to the claim that Korean industrialization was the "offspring" of Japanese industrialization
According to this theory farmers responded to the 17thcentury labour shortage caused by foreign invasions by adopting more efficient farming methods leading to greater commercialization and protoindustrialization which was curtailed by the Japanese interference from the late 19th century
It became the orthodox theory in school textbooks in both North and South Korea
However since the 1980s South Korean historians have largely discredited the theory
