From 1960 first as an instructor then as an Assistant professor
Also in 1964 and whilst still at MIT he was employed as a consultant by the RAND Corporation to review the work of Allen Newell and Herbert A Simon in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) The first edition of What Computers Cant Do would follow in 1972 and this critique of AI (which has been translated into at least ten languages) would establish Dreyfuss public reputation However as the editors of his Festschrift noted: "the study and interpretation of Continental philosophy

Dreyfus was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001  He was also awarded an honorary doctorate for "his brilliant and highly influential work in the field of artificial intelligence" and his interpretation of twentieth century continental philosophy by Erasmus University

Dreyfus died on April 22 2017

His younger brother and sometimes collaborator Stuart Dreyfus is a professor emeritus of industrial engineering and operations research at the University of California Berkeley

 Dreyfus criticism of AI 


Dreyfus critique of artificial intelligence (AI) concerns what he considers to be the four primary assumptions of AI research The first two assumptions are what he calls the "biological" and "psychological" assumptions The biological assumption is that the brain is analogous to computer hardware and the mind is analogous to computer software The psychological assumption is that the mind works by performing discrete computations (in the form of algorithmic rules) on discrete representations or symbols

Dreyfus claims that the plausibility of the psychological assumption rests on two others: the epistemology
On the basis of these two assumptions workers in the field claim that cognition is the manipulation of internal symbols by internal rules and that therefore human behaviour is to a large extent context free (see contextualism) Therefore a truly scientific psychology is possible which will detail the internal rules of the human mind in the same way the laws of physics detail the external laws of the physical world However it is this key assumption that Dreyfus denies In other words he argues that we cannot now (and never will be able to) understand our own behavior in the same way as we understand objects in for example physics or chemistry: that is by considering ourselves as things whose behaviour can be predicted via objective context free scientific laws According to Dreyfus a contextfree psychology is a contradiction in terms

Dreyfuss arguments against this position are taken from the Phenomenology (philosophy)
Dreyfus argues that to get a device or devices with humanlike intelligence would require them to have a humanlike beingintheworld and to have bodies more or less like ours and social acculturation (ie a society) more or less like ours (This view is shared by psychologists in the embodied psychology (Lakoff and Johnson 1999) and distributed cognition traditions His opinions are similar to those of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks as well as researchers in the field of artificial life)

Daniel Crevier writes: "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfuss comments Had he formulated them less aggressively constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier"

Webcasting philosophy
When UC Berkeley and Apple began making a selected number of lecture classes freely available to the public as podcasts beginning around 2006 a recording of Dreyfus teaching a course called "Man God and Society in Western Literature&nbsp;– From Gods to God and Back" rose to the 58th most popular webcast on iTunes These webcasts have attracted the attention of many including nonacademics to Dreyfus and his subject area
