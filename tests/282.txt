The dispute became public in November 2021 when the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that PATAFA demanded Obiena return financial assistance funds meant for Petrov accusing the pole vaulter of falsifying liquidation reports and embezzlement The accusation was strongly disputed by Obiena and Petrov

The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) has repeatedly attempted to arrange mediation for the two parties involved and the PSC even signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Philippine Dispute Resolution Center (PDRC)  However Obiena has declined mediation stating PATAFA is acting in bad faith   Obiena also noted that mediation is confidential and he would like the facts of the case to become public

The Philippine Olympic Committee and its general assembly members after a full vote have declared Juico as Persona non grata (Philippines)
Obiena hired the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to verify the accounting and bank details involving Petrov and Obiena has submitted this liquidation report directly to the PSC claiming it exonerates him  The Commission on Audit (Philippines)
Due Process

In any athlete NSA dispute due process should be followed  PATAFAs Bylaws do not explicitly state its dispute resolution mechanism for eligibility issues However as PATAFA is an IAAF Member PATAFA must abide by the rules of the IAAF Under the IAAF Rules on Disputes and Disciplinary Proceedings disputes between athletes and their NSAs must be submitted to an impartial and fair hearing body with the rights of the athlete respected at all times

Under the IAAF rule 60 Disputes and Disciplinary Proceedings: BlockquoteDisputes arising under the Rules and Regulations of a Member or Area Association

3 Each Member and Area Association shall incorporate a provision in its constitution that unless otherwise stated in a
specific Rule or Regulation all disputes and disciplinary proceedings arising under the rules and regulations of the Member
or Area Association involving athletes athlete support personnel or other persons under its jurisdiction however arising
shall be submitted to a hearing before the relevant hearing body constituted or otherwise authorised by the Member or
Area Association as the case may be Such a hearing shall respect the following principles:

(a) a timely hearing before a fair and impartial hearing body;

(b) the right of the individual to be informed in a fair and timely manner of the charge against him;

(c) the right to present evidence including the right to call and question witnesses;

(d) the right to be represented by legal counsel and an interpreter (at the individuals expense); and

(e) the right to a timely and reasoned decision in writing


In the Obiena case it is unclear if the IAAF procedures of due process were followed  PATAFA stated that investigations were conducted by its Administrative Committee who then submitted a factfinding Report to the PATAFA Board Commentators questioned whether PATAFAs committee is an “impartial and fair hearing body”

Background

Obiena began training with coach Petrov in 2014  The PSC approved funding for Petrov but liquidation was supposed to be handled through PATAFA  On many occasions due to accounting and currency exchange difficulties Obiena requested PATAFA to directly pay Petrov as shown in email exchanges to PATAFA as early as June 8 2020 Local Filipino coaches are often paid directly by PATAFA in Philippine peso
On Feb 16 2021 Juico stated: 

The PATAFA system required signed receipts prior to reimbursement requiring the athlete to front the money for unexpected expenses Petrov was aware of these payment difficulties with PATAFA and when contacted by Juico believed he was helping to improve PATAFAs inefficient system  No language translator was available to help Juico and Petrov communicate during their meeting  These topics were never mentioned or acknowledged by Juico and further PATAFA deceptively modified email exchanges to make it appear Obiena never sent Petrovs banking details

In Congressional hearings Obiena noted that PATAFA had difficulties managing the needs of the team during the Tokyo Olympics  International flights and hotels arrangements were sometimes bungled Obienas poles were ordered and delivered late on several occasions almost missing the Tokyo olympic deadline Without poles Obiena would have been unable to compete in the Olympic events These private PATAFA mistakes caused undue stress for the Obiena team

In November 2021 a Philippine Daily Inquirer report stated that Philippine Athletics Track and Field Association (PATAFA) ordered pole vaulter EJ Obiena to return financial assistance worth  (over ) allegedly due to "falsified the liquidations submitted" to the federation PATAFA stated that Obiena has not paid Vitaly Petrov (coach)
PATAFA President Philip Juico stated that the investigation was launched following a conversation between Bubka Petrov and himself in September 2021 It has been observed that Petrov does not speak English very well

According to Obiena PATAFAs written allegation against him shifted from him embezzling funds to paying his coach late In January 2022 the PATAFA board has recommended filing estafa (swindling) criminal case against Obiena and his mother Jeannete for alleged misappropriation of funds

Positions
EJ Obiena
Obiena in response to PATAFAs accusation against him which was reported by Inquirer stated that the allegations are "rumors" that are "100% false and represent nothing more than character assassination" He mentioned that he has filed a complaint to the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and World Athletics He has also appeared in an online press conference along with Petrov himself who backed Obienas claim that he has been paid in full

On November 21 Obiena presented documentary evidence that he has paid Petrov on time from May 2018 to August 2021 The pole vaulter has hired the service of PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit his payments though he admitted that some liquidation documents were processed late or in "a sloppy fashion"

While he admitted to occasionally paying his coach late Obiena also raised that if PATAFA had been paying his coach directly the issue would not arise while he adds that he had request the federation in the past to do so but such proposal has been denied He said that he would rather focus on training than doing additional accounting and other administration work

Vitaly Petrov
Vitaly Petrov (athletics)
Petrov mentioned he and Sergey Bubka being approached personally by PATAFA President Philip Juico He accused Juico of misleading him by making him take a questionnaire and being pressured to answer in a way Juico wanted Petrov added he was made to understand that the questionnaire was made in order to facilitate smoother payments

On January 26 2022 he issued another statement claiming that PATAFA under Juico "never done anything to help develop Obiena" He expressed the federations move to kick out Obiena from the national team "for nothing" despite having become one of the top five pole vaulters in the world

PATAFA
PATAFA confirmed that its investigation over Obiena is a response to written letters by Sergey Bubka and Vitaly Petrov (athletics)
PATAFA President Philip Juico denied accusations that he had pressured Petrov saying that the coach answered freely and volunteered information to him over the salary matter He insinuated that Petrov is seeking to recant his statement since Petrov is with Obiena in Italy and the coach could end up losing more money

On January 4 2022 PATAFAs board recommended expelling Obiena from the national team pool and filing estafa (swindling) case against the athlete It also recommended filing a case against Petrov before the World Athletics for violation of the Integrity Code of Conduct and declared Obienas adviser Jim Lafferty as Persona non grata (Philippines)
PATAFA on January 28 2022 released a statement saying it considers its dispute with Obiena as "case closed" after it submitted its findings of its investigation to the Philippine Sports Commission and the Commission on Audit (Philippines)
Response
Congress probe
Philippine Senators quickly came to Obienas defense calling unproven accusations "harassment" against an athlete considered a national treasure and passing a motion to recall the budget of the PSC  The Senators later approved the PSC budget with the condition that PATAFA will “rectify the grave injustice” done to Obienas reputation  During congressional hearings witnesses testified that PATAFAs payment system is broken

A probe regarding the matter at the House of Representatives of the Philippines
Philippine Sports Commission mediation
The Philippine governments sports agency the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) first offered to facilitate a mediation between Obienas camp and PATAFA in November 2021 Obiena verbally stated that he is opened to the mediation but claims that PATAFA ignored PSCs move In December 2021 Obiena reiterated his willingness for a PSCled mediation but said he would prefer the Philippine Olympic Committee to finish its own investigation on his affair with PATAFA The PSC would honor Obienas stance and temporarily withdrew its mediation efforts

PSC mediation efforts would continue in January 2022 with both camps reportedly willing to enter to Efforts for mediation collapsed after Obiena withdrew from participating in the potential PSCled mediation accusing PATAFA of acting on bad faith believing that the federaation still intends to pursue the filing of a criminal cases of estafa against him which he said is baseless He also expressed reluctance to enter to a confidential mediation since he took a stance that he has "nothing to hide" and acknowledged PSC commissioner Butch Ramirez as a peacemaker for initiating mediation

Following the development Ramirez pleads the two parties to resolve their issues even through just informal talks while he maintained that mediation is the best option He asked Obiena to be "humble" and not "listen to people around him" also pleading to the athlete lawyers and for Juico to "act like a father" to the athlete

Philippine Olympic Committee
On December 28 the Philippine Olympic Committee declared PATAFA President Philip Juico as Persona non grata (Philippines)
Juico contests the decision insisting that his affair with Obiena is an intranational sports association (NSA) issue which he pointed out that according to POCs own constitution should be solved within the NSA first before the POC could intervene While he added that the POC may have believed that Obienas issue is not a intraNSA issue since Obiena launched a complaint to the POC regarding Juicos alleged harassment of the athlete he maintains that the issue is between the management and board of PATAFA and Obiena; not merely between Obiena and himself or Obiena and the PATAFA organization itself

The POC ratified its decision to tag Juico as Persona non grata (Philippines)
Other reactions
Reacting to Obienas dispute with the PATAFA the Philippine government through Presidential spokesperson (Philippines)
Rappler and InterAksyon reports that sentiment in social media were generally supportive of Obiena Obiena also has public support from other athletes such as boxer Eumir Marcial and politicians such as Senators Manny Pacquiao and Tito Sotto and Kabataan representative Sarah Elago Within PATAFA Juicos administration has backing from officials coaches and athletes who came up with a signed and written manifesto expressing their support

Impact to Obienas career
Resignation and nationality change
Obiena is among the top pole vaulters placing third in the World Athletics mens pole vault ranking by the end of 2021 He also initially threatened to resign when the issue between him and PATAFA arose in late 2021

The PATAFAs board recommended the expulsion of Obiena from the national team pool on January 4 2022

Despite the dispute with PATAFA Obiena maintained that he would not List of eligibility transfers in athletics
Endorsement for international competitions
On January 25 the Philippine Olympic Committee assured Obiena he could still compete at the upcoming 2021 Southeast Asian Games
On January 28 2021 PATAFA issued a statement equating Obienas decision to have "chosen to remove himself from the jurisdiction of Patafa" and "to align work with and avail himself of total support purportedly guaranteed by his patrons agents and political backers" It insists that it has decided to focus on developing the remaining members of the national team pool

On February 7 2022 the Philippine Senate held hearings on the Obiena PATAFA dispute  Senator Pia Cayetano led the hearings and stated her goal is to craft legislation which will lift the administrative burden from athletes and let them focus on competition  Both Obiena and Juico testified with detailed presentations giving their side of the dispute

There was a concern that the move might be construed as government interference since after PATAFA Juico was cited for contempt in a Senate hearing potentially endangering the Philippines participation in international tournaments

PATAFA did not endorse Obienas participation in the 2021 Southeast Asian Games the 2022 World Athletics Indoor Championships and the 2022 Asian Games According to PATAFA it did not act on Obienas letter dated February 24 2022 seeking formal endorsements to participate in these tournaments citing that "deferral of any action on EJ Obienas letter is consistent with the directive of the Senate Committee to undergo mediation which PATAFA is currently participating in" The POC also suspended PATAFA in response on March 18 2022 This meant that PATAFA would not be accredited by POC to represent the country in international competitions PATAFA says that the move deprive it of due process However this move was later deferred

Nevertheless the POC has included Obiena in the entry by names list of the Philippine delegation for the 2021 Southeast Asian Games and has relayed Obienas situation to World Athletics A precedent was Lydia de Vegas participation in the 1985 ASEAN Cup despite a dispute with suspended PATAFA president Michael Keon

ISTAF Berlin
Obiena competed at the mens pole vault competition in the 2022 ISTAF Berlin marking his return to international competition since the dispute arose He finished with a record of 570 meters

Resolution
On March 30 2022 the Philippine Sports Commission announced that both parties has reach an agreement during the mediation process The PSC relayed that Obiena has apologized to PATAFA Juico and his teammates and it was agreed upon that the pole vaulters participation in international tournaments including the 2021 Southeast Asian Games and the 2022 World Athletics Championships
On March 31 2022  Obiena received clearance from the Commission on Audit (COA) finding no wrong doing and thus officially settling the liquidation issue  In its letter COA stated: "based on our regular audit of your liquidation the related expenditures for the following financial assistance granted for your training were in order" The COA notice officially refuted PATAFA’s allegations that Obiena committed estafa
