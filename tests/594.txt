 2022 World Cup controversy 
In March 2022 Kuliak wore a Z (military symbol)
On 6 March the FIG announced that they will ask the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation to open disciplinary proceedings against Kuliak In a subsequent interview on Tuesday 8 March Kuliak said that he had no regrets and would "do exactly the same" On 18 March he appeared at the 2022 Moscow rally wearing an Olympic medal though he has not competed in the Olympics

On 17 May the FIG sanctioned Kuliak with a oneyear ban ending 17 May 2023 or six months after the ban on Russian athletes is lifted and ruled that he is to be stripped of his bronze medal and prize money

On 14 September it was announced that Kuliaks appeal against his suspension was partially upheld The Gymnastics Ethics Foundation (GEF) Appeal Tribunal found that the oneyear sanctions should be independent from measures preventing Russian gymnasts from competing at FIG events This means his suspension would last until May 16 2023
