Female athletes have stated they complained to authorities  including various employees at Michigan State University  about Nassars behavior starting in at least 1997 with some athletes stating abuse occurred in 1994

In September 2016 USA Gymnastics cut ties with Nassar "after learning of athlete concerns" On September 20 2016 The Indianapolis Star had reported that Rachael Denhollander and another former gymnast had accused Nassar of sexual abuse After having been reassigned from clinical and teaching duties in August Nassar was fired by Michigan State University on September&nbsp;20 2016

In May 2017 victim impact statements during pretrial hearings sentencing and later interviews several victims described Nassars modus operandi: after having gained a girls trust and friendship he would insert his ungloved finger into her vagina during physical therapy describing this as normal "pressure point" therapy for pain relief On some of these occasions a parent was in the room unaware of what happened

In October 2017 Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney using the MeToo hashtag on Twitter said that Nassar had repeatedly molested her from 2008 when she was 13 years old until she retired from the sport in 2016 Maroney subsequently filed a lawsuit against Nassar Michigan State University the United States Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics The lawsuit accused USA Gymnastics of covering up the sexual abuse by requiring her to sign a nondisclosure agreement in her $125 million settlement Maroneys attorney John Manly called Nassar a "pedophile doctor"

Maroney testified that she was met with silence by an FBI agent after telling the agent of Nassars "&nbsp;molestations in extreme detail" She further stated that the FBI falsified her statement said the agents involved should be indicted and criticized Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco for not appearing at the hearing Raisman testified that the FBI made her feel that the "abuse didnt count" but she felt it "was like serving innocent children up to a pedophile on a silver platter" After the testimony by the gymnasts FBI Director Christopher A Wray testified speaking to the gymnasts that he was "deeply and profoundly sorry that so many people let you down over and over again"

According to a report issued in July&nbsp;2021 by the Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz at least 70&nbsp;more athletes were subjected to abuse between the time of reports to the FBI and the arrest of Nassar by state authorities while Nassars victims stated that the number abused in that period was 120

On April 6 2017 his medical license was revoked for three years

On July&nbsp;11 2017 Nassar pleaded guilty to receiving child pornography in 2004 possession of pornographic images of children dating from 2004 to 2016 and tampering with evidence by destroying and concealing the images Judge Janet T Neff sentenced Nassar to 60 years in federal prison (three consecutive terms of 20 years) on December 7 2017 followed by United States federal probation and supervised release

On January 24 2018 Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of Ingham County sentenced Nassar to a minimum of 40 to a maximum of 175 years in prison for the sexual assault of minors Upon release Nassar would have to register as a Michigan sex offender for the rest of his life That part of the sentence was purely symbolic as Nassar’s federal and state sentences are consecutive essentially guaranteeing he will die in prison Aquilina allowed Nassars accusers to present extended victim impact statements and dismissed objections raised to this ruling by Nassar During the sentencing the judge informed Nassar that he had missed numerous chances to receive treatment for his sexual urges as Nassar had been aware of these urges himself from a young age She also said that there were likely dozens of additional victims who had not come forward and made it clear that Nassar will never be free again

Nassar was practicing without a Texas medical license while he worked at the Karolyi Ranch which since 2001 had been the USA Gymnastics designated US Womens National Gymnastics Training Center in Huntsville Texas According to McKayla Maroney this was where Nassar molested young women for more than 15&nbsp;years Practicing medicine without a license in Texas is a thirddegree felony although it is rarely prosecuted On January 31 2018 a Michigan judge said that there were "over 265 identified victims and an infinite number of victims" of sexual misconduct

Incarceration
Nassar spent time in the Eaton County Michigan
On July 9 2023 Nassar was stabbed by another inmate who was upset by a lewd comment Nassar made about girls while they were watching Wimbledon on TV He was stabbed twice in the neck six times in the chest twice in the back and suffered a collapsed lung He survived the attack in stable condition After being treated at a nearby hospital he was transferred to United States Penitentiary Lewisburg
Nassars earliest potential release from federal prison is January 30 2068 He will likely die serving his federal sentence as it far exceeds human life expectancy and his earliest possible release will be when he is 104 years old However if Nassar is still alive when he becomes eligible for release from federal prison upon his release he would be immediately transferred to a Michigan state prison to serve his concurrent state sentences He would then have to serve a minimum of 40 years in state prison before being eligible for parole Per Aquilina if Nassar survives he will have to register as a sex offender in Michigan for the rest of his life

Aftermath
As of 2018 more than 150&nbsp;federal and state lawsuits had been filed against Nassar Michigan State University the US Olympic Committee USA Gymnastics and the Twistars Gymnastics Club The entire 18&nbsp;member board of USA Gymnastics including Steve Penny tendered their resignations Michigan State University (MSU) President Lou Anna Simon and MSU Director of Athletics Mark Hollis (athletic director)
Nassars crimes committed at MSU and USA Gymnastics have drawn comparisons to coach Jerry Sanduskys sexual abuse crimes at Penn State University In both of these cases institutional authorities "turned the other way" or tried to hide the activities of a child molester instead of immediately contacting law enforcement

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette promised a full investigation into how Nassar was able to abuse young women for decades while working at the states university MSU agreed to pay $500 million to 332 of Nassars alleged victims settling lawsuits filed by the victims This was the largest amount of money in history settled by a university for a sexual abuse case On Christmas Eve 2019 Schuettes successor Dana Nessel announced that she was suspending the investigation

More than 140&nbsp;victims of Nassars abuse appeared on stage together at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles California on July 18 2018 to receive the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at the 2018 ESPY Awards
In late July&nbsp;2018 it was reported that Nassar was seeking a new sentencing hearing due to concerns of perceived bias by Aquilina but his request was denied by Eaton County Judge Janice Cunningham

In 2019 HBO released a documentary about Nassars serial sexual abuse and subsequent coverups by the various institutions he worked with titled At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal The 2020 Netflix documentary Athlete A is also based on Nassars scandal and crimes Later that year Nassars request for a sentencing hearing for the Ingham County charges in addition to the accusations of Aquilina being biased were rejected by the Michigan Court of Appeals
