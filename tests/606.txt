The AI effect occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not "real" intelligence

Author Pamela McCorduck writes: "Its part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something—play good checkers solve simple but relatively informal problems—there was a chorus of critics to say thats not thinking" Researcher Rodney Brooks complains: "Every time we figure out a piece of it it stops being magical; we say Oh thats just a computation"

Definition
"The AI effect" is that line of thinking the tendency to redefine AI to mean: "AI is anything that has not been done yet" This is the common public misperception that as soon as AI successfully solves a problem that solution method is no longer within the domain of AI Geist credits John McCarthy (computer scientist)
McCorduck calls it an "odd paradox" that "practical AI successes computational programs that actually achieved intelligent behavior were soon assimilated into whatever application domain they were found to be useful in and became silent partners alongside other problemsolving approaches which left AI researchers to deal only with the failures the tough nuts that couldnt yet be cracked" It is an example of moving the goalposts

Teslers Theorem is:
<blockquote>"AI is whatever hasnt been done yet"<br/>
Larry Tesler</blockquote>
Douglas Hofstadter quotes this as do many other commentators

When problems have not yet been formalised they can still be characterised by a model of computation that includes human computation The computational burden of a problem is split between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by a human This formalisation is referred to as a AI completeFormalisation
 AI applications become mainstream 
File:Monsanto’s Future — Farming in 2030 (8427734799)jpgSoftware and algorithms developed by AI researchers are now integrated into many applications throughout the world without really being called AI This underappreciation is known from such diverse fields as computer chess marketing and hospitality industry

According to Stottler Henke "The great practical benefits of AI applications and even the existence of AI in many software products go largely unnoticed by many despite the already widespread use of AI techniques in software This is the AI effect Many marketing people dont use the term artificial intelligence even when their companys products rely on some AI techniques Why not?"<ref namehenke>cite web

Marvin Minsky writes "This paradox resulted from the fact that whenever an AI research project made a useful new discovery that product usually quickly spun off to form a new scientific or commercial specialty with its own distinctive name These changes in name led outsiders to ask Why do we see so little progress in the central field of artificial intelligence?"

Nick Bostrom observes that "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labelled AI anymore"<ref>Quoted in Cite web   </ref>

The AI effect on decisionmaking in supply chain risk management is a severely understudied area

To avoid the AI effect problem the editors of a special issue of IEEE Software on AI and software engineering recommend not overselling  not hype (marketing)
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists organization views the AI effect as a worldwide strategic military threat As they point out it obscures the fact that applications of AI had already found their way into both US and Soviet Armed Forces
For example AI helps YouTube review uploaded videos and replaces employees who were previously responsible for reviewing them About 47% of jobs are predicted to be replaced by AI in the next 20 years

 Legacy of the AI winter 


Many AI researchers find that they can get more funding and sell more software if they avoid the bad name of "artificial intelligence" and instead pretend their work has nothing to do with intelligence at all This was especially true in the early 1990s during the second "AI winter"

Patty Tascarella writes: "Some believe the word robotics actually carries a stigma that hurts a companys chances at funding"<ref>cite news

 Saving a place for humanity at the top of the chain of being 
Michael Kearns (computer scientist)       available from Phillycom
</ref>
By discounting artificial intelligence people can continue to feel unique and special Kearns argues that the change in perception known as the AI effect can be traced to the mystery being removed from the system In being able to trace the cause of events implies that its a form of automation rather than intelligence

A related effect has been noted in the history of animal cognition and in consciousness studies where every time a capacity formerly thought as uniquely human is discovered in animals (eg the Tool use by animals
Herbert A Simon when asked about the lack of AIs press coverage at the time said "What made AI different was that the very idea of it arouses a real fear and hostility in some human breasts So you are getting very strong emotional reactions But thats okay Well live with that"<ref>

The future


Experts agree the AI effect certainly – or probably While not addressing the AI effect directly some writers have speculated the indefinite perpetuity of this phenomenon may be due to artificial intelligence itself as Moores law is

The AI effect may grow to include dismissal of all specialised artificial intelligences
