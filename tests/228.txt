The Geologic Calendar is a scale in which the geological timespan of the Earth is mapped onto a calendrical year; that is to say the day one of the Earth took place on a geologic January 1 at precisely midnight and todays date and time is December 31 at midnight On this calendar the inferred appearance of the first living singlecelled organisms prokaryotes occurred on a geologic February 25 around 12:30pm to 1:07pm dinosaurs first appeared on December 13 the first flower plants on December 22 and the first primates on December 28 at about 9:43pm The first anatomically modern humans did not arrive until around 11:48&nbsp;pm on New Years Eve and all of human history since the Holocene
A variation of this analogy instead compresses Earths 46 billion yearold history into a single day: While the Earth still forms at midnight and the present day is also represented by midnight the first life on Earth would appear at 4:00am  dinosaurs would appear at 10:00pm the first flowers 10:30pm the first primates 11:30pm and modern humans would not appear until the last two seconds of 11:59pm 

A third analogy created by University of Washington paleontologist Peter Ward and astronomer Donald Brownlee who are both famous for their Rare Earth hypothesis for their book The Life and Death of Planet Earth alters the calendar so it includes the Earths future leading up to the Suns death in the next 5 billion years As a result each month now represents 1 of 12 billion years of the Earths life According to this calendar the first life appears in January and the first animals first appeared in May with the present day taking place on May 18 even though the Sun wont destroy Earth until December 31 all animals will die out by the end of May

Use of the geologic calendar as a conceptual aid dates back at least to the mid 20th century for example in Richard Carringtons 1956 book A Guide to Earth History and Gove Hambidges 1941 chapter in the book Climate and Man Some authors also used a similar imaginative device of compressing the entire history of the human species to a shorter period whether a single year as in Ramsay Muirs 1940 book Civilization and Liberty or fiftyyear span as in James Harvey Robinsons 1921 book The Mind in the Making
