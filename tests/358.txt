The term contour currents was first introduced by Heezen et al in 1966 as bottom currents along the continental shelf driven by Coriolis force
 Depositional Processes 
Since contour currents generally flow at speed of 2â€“20 cm/s their capacity to carry sediments is limited to fine grain particles already in suspension Redistribution of sediments by contour currents have however been reported as evidenced by the sea floor morphological features parallel to regional IsobathTurbidity currents on the other hand flow down slope across regional isobaths and are mainly responsible for supplying terrigenous sediment across continental margins to deepwater environments such as continental rise where fine particles are further carried in suspension by contour currents The joint depositional processes of the two current systems contribute to the dominant factors influencing the Geomorphology
