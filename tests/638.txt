In 2005 the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to its member institutions for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice This examination was done in accordance with NCAA policy that requires each member institution to maintain an "atmosphere of respect for and sensitivity to the dignity of every person" Fourteen schools either removed all references to Native American culture or were deemed not to have references to Native American culture as part
of their athletics programs Subsequently 19 teams were cited as having potentially "hostile or abusive" names mascots or images that would be banned from displaying them during postseason play and prohibited from hosting tournaments

Controversies
San Diego State University was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants A SDSU professor of American Indian Studies states that among other problems the mascot teaches the mistaken idea that the Aztecs were a local tribe rather than living in Mexico 1000 miles away However in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supports removal of the mascot calling its continue use "institutional racism" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity Equity and Outreach Although that resolution was rejected by the SDSU Associated Students the University Senate which represents the administration faculty staff and students has voted to phase out the human depiction of the Aztec Warrior A task force of students faculty and alumni studied the issue and recommended keeping the name but modify the mascot performance and certain references used in other contexts However there are few signs of this recommendation being implemented

The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign Illinois Fighting Illini
The University of North Dakota challenged the NCAA policy in court and settled in 2007 when it was given three years to obtain consent from the Sioux tribes in the state When one tribe refused permission the state Board of Higher Education proceeded with plans to eliminate the North Dakota Fighting Hawks

Waivers granted
The NCAA has granted waivers from their mascot policy to five university teams originally on the "hostile and abusive" list that obtained official support from individual tribes for the use of their names and images based upon the principle of Tribal sovereignty in the United States
