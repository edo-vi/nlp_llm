Biosemiotics (from the Ancient Greek
Biosemiotics integrates the findings of biology and semiotics and proposes a paradigm shift
Insights from biosemiotics have also been adopted in the humanities and social sciences including Anthrozoology
Definition
Biosemiotics is biology interpreted as a sign systems study or to elaborate a study of 
* Sign (semiotics)* semiosis (creating and changing sign relations) in living nature
* the biological basis of all signs and sign interpretation

Main branches
According to the basic types of semiosis under study biosemiotics can be   divided into 
*vegetative semiotics (also endosemiotics or phytosemiotics)<ref>Witzany G. 2006. Plant Communication from Biosemiotic Perspective. 
Plant Signaling & Behavior 1(4): 169-178.</ref> the study of semiosis at the cellular and molecular level (including the translation processes related to genome and the organic form or phenotype); vegetative semiosis occurs in all organisms at their cellular and tissue level; vegetative semiotics includes prokaryote semiotics sign-mediated interactions in bacteria communities such as quorum sensing and quorum quenching.
*zoosemiotics or animal semiotics or the study of animal forms of knowing; animal semiosis occurs in the organisms with neuromuscular system also includes anthroposemiotics the study of semiotic behavior in humans.

According to the dominant aspect of semiosis under study the following labels have been used: biopragmatics biosemantics and biosyntactics.

History
Apart from Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) and Charles W. Morris (1903–1979) early pioneers of biosemiotics were Jakob von Uexküll (1864–1944) Heini Hediger (1908–1992) Giorgio Prodi (1928–1987) Marcel Florkin (1900–1979) and Friedrich S. Rothschild (1899–1995); the founding fathers of the contemporary interdiscipline were Thomas Sebeok (1920–2001) and Thure von Uexküll (1908–2004).

In the 1980s a circle of mathematicians active in Theoretical Biology René Thom (Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques) Yannick Kergosien (Dalhousie University and Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques) and Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)
The contemporary period (as initiated by Copenhagen-Tartu school) include biologists Jesper Hoffmeyer Kalevi Kull Claus Emmeche Terrence Deacon semioticians Martin Krampen Paul Cobley philosophers Donald Favareau John Deely John Collier and complex systems scientists Howard H. Pattee Michael Conrad (biologist)
In 2001 an annual international conference for biosemiotic research known as the Gatherings in Biosemiotics was inaugurated and has taken place every year since.

In 2004 a group of biosemioticians – Marcello Barbieri Claus Emmeche Jesper Hoffmeyer Kalevi Kull and Anton Markos – decided to establish an international journal of biosemiotics. Under their editorship the Journal of Biosemiotics was launched by Nova Science Publishers in 2005 (two issues published) and with the same five editors Biosemiotics (journal)
The International Society for Biosemiotic Studies was established in 2005 by Donald Favareau and the five editors listed above. A collective programmatic paper on the basic theses of biosemiotics appeared in 2009. and in 2010 an 800 page textbook and anthology Essential Readings in Biosemiotics was published with bibliographies and commentary by Donald Favareau.

In 2016 Springer published Biosemiotic Medicine: Healing in the World of Meaning edited by Farzad Goli as part of Studies in Neuroscience Consciousness and Spirituality. 

In the humanities
Since the work of Jakob von Uexküll and Martin Heidegger several scholars in the humanities have engaged with or appropriated ideas from biosemiotics in their own projects; conversely biosemioticians have critically engaged with or reformulated humanistic theories using ideas from biosemiotics and complexity theory. For instance Andreas Weber (writer)
In 2021 the American philosopher Jason Josephson Storm has drawn on biosemiotics and empirical research on animal communication to propose hylosemiotics a theory of ontology and communication that Storm believes could allow the humanities to move beyond the linguistic turn.

John Deelys work also represents an engagement between humanistic and biosemiotic approaches. Deely was trained as a historian and not a biologist but discussed biosemiotics and zoosemiotics extensively in his introductory works on semiotics and clarified terms that are relevant for biosemiotics. Although his idea of physiosemiotics was criticized by practicing biosemioticians Paul Cobley Donald Favareau and Kalevi Kull wrote that "the debates on this conceptual point between Deely and the biosemiotics community were always civil and marked by a mutual admiration for the contributions of the other towards the advancement of our understanding of sign relations."
