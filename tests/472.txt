<! Definition >
Herd immunity (also called herd effect community immunity population immunity or mass immunity) is a form of indirect protection that applies only to contagious diseases It occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become Immunity (medical)
<! Methods >Once the herd immunity has been reached disease gradually disappears from a population and may result in Eradication of infectious diseases
Effects
Protection of those without immunity
File:WHO EN Herd Immunity Illustration 02 8Dec2020pngSome individuals either cannot develop immunity after vaccination or for medical reasons cannot be vaccinated Newborn infants are too young to receive many vaccines either for safety reasons or because passive immunity renders the vaccine ineffective Individuals who are immunodeficient due to HIV/AIDS lymphoma leukemia bone marrow cancer an impaired spleen chemotherapy or Radiation therapy
A portion of those vaccinated may not develop longterm immunity Vaccine contraindications may prevent certain individuals from being vaccinated

High levels of immunity in one age group can create herd immunity for other age groups This is especially important for close family members who account for most of the transmissions to young infants Vaccinating children against pneumococcus and rotavirus has had the effect of reducing Streptococcus pneumoniae
For sexually transmitted infections (STIs) high levels of immunity in heterosexuals of one sex induces herd immunity for heterosexuals of both sexes Vaccines against STIs that are targeted at heterosexuals of one sex result in significant declines in STIs in heterosexuals of both sexes if vaccine uptake in the target sex is high Herd immunity from female vaccination does not however extend to males who have sex with males Highrisk behaviors make eliminating STIs difficult because even though most infections occur among individuals with moderate risk the majority of transmissions occur because of individuals who engage in highrisk behaviors For this reason in certain populations it may be necessary to immunize highrisk individuals regardless of sex

Evolutionary pressure and serotype replacement
Herd immunity itself acts as an evolutionary pressure on pathogens influencing viral evolution by encouraging the production of novel strains referred to as escape mutants that are able to evade herd immunity and infect previously immune individuals The evolution of new strains is known as serotype replacement or serotype shifting as the prevalence of a specific serotype declines due to high levels of immunity allowing other serotypes to replace it

At the molecular level viruses escape from herd immunity through antigenic drift which is when mutations accumulate in the portion of the VirusGenome
Initial vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae significantly reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes (VTs) including Antimicrobial resistance
Eradication of diseases

If herd immunity has been established and maintained in a population for a sufficient time the disease is inevitably eliminatedno more endemic transmissions occur

The benefits of eradication include ending all DiseaseMorbidity
Free riding
Herd immunity is vulnerable to the free rider problem Individuals who lack immunity including those who choose not to vaccinate free ride off the herd immunity created by those who are immune Bandwagon effect
Mechanism
Individuals who are immune to a disease act as a barrier in the spread of disease slowing or preventing the transmission of disease to others An individuals immunity can be acquired via a natural infection or through artificial means such as vaccination When a critical proportion of the population becomes immune called the herd immunity threshold (HIT) or herd immunity level (HIL) the disease may no longer persist in the population ceasing to be Endemic (epidemiology)
The theoretical basis for herd immunity generally assumes that vaccines induce solid immunity that populations mix at random that the pathogen does not evolve to evade the immune response and that there is no nonhuman vector for the disease

Theoretical basis




The critical value or threshold in a given population is the point where the disease reaches an Mathematical modelling of infectious diseaseEndemic steady state
: <math> R_0 \cdot S1 </math>

S can be rewritten as (1 − p) where p is the proportion of the population that is immune so that p + S equals one Then the equation can be rearranged to place p by itself as follows:

: <math> R_0 \cdot (1p)1 </math>
: <math> 1p\frac   </math>
: <math> p_c1  \frac   </math>

With p being by itself on the left side of the equation it can be renamed as p<sub>c</sub> representing the critical proportion of the population needed to be immune to stop the transmission of disease which is the same as the "herd immunity threshold" HIT R<sub>0</sub> functions as a measure of contagiousness so low R<sub>0</sub> values are associated with lower HITs whereas higher R<sub>0</sub>s result in higher HITs For example the HIT for a disease with an R<sub>0</sub> of 2 is theoretically only 50% whereas a disease with an R<sub>0</sub> of 10 the theoretical HIT is 90%

When the effective reproduction number R<sub>e</sub> of a contagious disease is reduced to and sustained below 1 new individual per infection the number of cases occurring in the population gradually decreases until the disease has been eliminated If a population is immune to a disease in excess of that diseases HIT the number of cases reduces at a faster rate outbreaks are even less likely to happen and outbreaks that occur are smaller than they would be otherwise If the effective reproduction number increases to above 1 then the disease is neither in a steady state nor decreasing in Incidence (epidemiology)
An assumption in these calculations is that populations are homogeneous or wellmixed meaning that every individual is equally likely to come into contact with any other individual when in reality populations are better described as social networks as individuals tend to cluster together remaining in relatively close contact with a limited number of other individuals In these networks transmission only occurs between those who are geographically or physically close to one another

In heterogeneous populations R<sub>0</sub> is considered to be a measure of the number of cases generated by a "typical" infectious person which depends on how individuals within a network interact with each other Interactions within networks are more common than between networks in which case the most highly connected networks transmit disease more easily resulting in a higher R<sub>0</sub> and a higher HIT than would be required in a less connected network In networks that either opt not to become immune or are not immunized sufficiently diseases may persist despite not existing in betterimmunized networks


Overshoot
The cumulative proportion of individuals who get infected during the course of a disease outbreak can exceed the HIT This is because the HIT does not represent the point at which the disease stops spreading but rather the point at which each infected person infects fewer than one additional person on average When the HIT is reached the number of additional infections does not immediately drop to zero The excess of the cumulative proportion of infected individuals over the theoretical HIT is known as the overshoot

Boosts


Vaccination



The primary way to boost levels of immunity in a population is through vaccination Vaccination is originally based on the observation that milkmaids exposed to cowpox were immune to smallpox so the practice of inoculation
The immune system does not distinguish between natural infections and vaccines forming an Immunity (medical)Active immunity
Assuming a vaccine is 100% effective then the equation used for calculating the herd immunity threshold can be used for calculating the vaccination level needed to eliminate a disease written as V<sub>c</sub> Vaccines are usually imperfect however so the effectiveness E of a vaccine must be accounted for:

: <math> V_c\frac   </math>

From this equation it can be observed that if E is less than (1 − 1/R<sub>0</sub>) then it is impossible to eliminate a disease even if the entire population is vaccinated Similarly waning vaccineinduced immunity as occurs with DPT vaccineCombination vaccines with acellular pertussisFile:Measles cases coverage eastern mediterraneanjpg: <math> \left(1  \frac  \right)  (E \times p_v) </math>

It can be observed from this equation that all other things being equal ("ceteris paribus") any increase in either vaccine coverage or vaccine effectiveness including any increase in excess of a diseases HIT further reduces the number of cases of a disease The rate of decline in cases depends on a diseases R<sub>0</sub> with diseases with lower R<sub>0</sub> values experiencing sharper declines

Vaccines usually have at least one contraindication for a specific population for medical reasons but if both effectiveness and coverage are high enough then herd immunity can protect these individuals so additional doses are recommended for some vaccines while others are not administered until after an individual has lost his or her passive immunity

Passive immunity


Individual immunity can also be gained passively when Antibody
Protection generated from passive immunity is immediate but wanes over the course of weeks to months so any contribution to herd immunity is temporary For diseases that are especially severe among fetuses and newborns such as influenza and tetanus pregnant women may be immunized in order to transfer antibodies to the child In the same way highrisk groups that are either more likely to experience infection or are more likely to develop complications from infection may receive antibody preparations to prevent these infections or to reduce the severity of symptoms

Cost–benefit analysis
Herd immunity is often accounted for when conducting Cost–benefit analysis
History
File:Measles US 19382019png
Herd immunity was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when it was observed that after a significant number of children had become immune to measles the number of new infections temporarily decreased Mass vaccination to induce herd immunity has since become common and proved successful in preventing the spread of many infectious diseases Vaccine hesitancy
The exact herd immunity threshold (HIT) varies depending on the basic reproduction number of the disease An example of a disease with a high threshold was the measles with a HIT exceeding 95%

The term "herd immunity" was first used in 1894 by American veterinary scientist and then Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the US Department of Agriculture Daniel Elmer Salmon to describe the healthy vitality and resistance to disease of wellfed herds of hogs In 1916 veterinary scientists inside the same Bureau of Animal Industry used the term to refer to the immunity arising following recovery in cattle infected with brucellosis also known as "contagious abortion" By 1923 it was being used by British bacteriologists to describe experimental epidemics with mice experiments undertaken as part of efforts to model human epidemic disease By the end of the 1920s the concept was used extensively  particularly among British scientists  to describe the build up of immunity in populations to diseases such as diphtheria scarlet fever and influenza Herd immunity was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when A W Hedrich published research on the epidemiology of measles in Baltimore and took notice that after many children had become immune to measles the number of new infections temporarily decreased including among susceptible children

Since the adoption of mass and ring vaccination complexities and challenges to herd immunity have arisen Modeling of the spread of infectious disease originally made a number of assumptions namely that entire populations are susceptible and wellmixed which is not the case in reality so more precise equations have been developed In recent decades it has been recognized that the dominant strain of a microorganism in circulation may change due to herd immunity either because of herd immunity acting as an evolutionary pressure or because herd immunity against one strain allowed another alreadyexisting strain to spread Emerging or ongoing fears and controversies about vaccination have reduced or eliminated herd immunity in certain communities allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to these communities
