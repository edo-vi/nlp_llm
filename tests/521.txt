A classic is a book accepted as being exemplary or particularly noteworthy What makes a book "classic" is a concern that has occurred to various authors ranging from Italo Calvino to Mark Twain and the related questions of "Why Read the Classics?" and "What Is a Classic?" have been essayed by authors from different genres and eras (including Calvino T S Eliot Charles Augustin SainteBeuve)  The ability of a classic book to be reinterpreted to seemingly be renewed in the interests of generations of readers succeeding its creation is a theme that is seen in the writings of literary critics including Michael Dirda Ezra Pound and SainteBeuve These books can be published as a collection (such as Great Books of the Western World Modern Library or Penguin Classics) or presented as a list such as Harold Blooms list of books that constitute the Western canon  Although the term is often associated with the Western canon it can be applied to works of literature from all traditions such as the Chinese classics or the Indian Vedas

Many universities incorporate these readings into their curricula such as "The Reading List" at St Johns College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)
History
In 1850 Charles Augustin SainteBeuve (1804–1869) stated his answer to the question "What is a Classic?" ("Questce quun classique?"):<ref>Citation
</ref> 
<blockquote>The idea of a classic implies something that has continuance and consistence and which produces unity and tradition fashions and transmits itself and endures A true classic as I should like to hear it defined is an author who has enriched the human mind increased its treasure and caused it to advance a step; who has discovered some moral and not equivocal truth or revealed some eternal passion in that heart where all seemed known and discovered; who has expressed his thought observation or invention in no matter what form only provided it be broad and great refined and sensible sane and beautiful in itself; who has spoken to all in his own peculiar style a style which is found to be also that of the whole world a style new without neologism new and old easily contemporary with all time</blockquote>

File:SainteBeuvejpgIn this same essay SainteBeuve quoted Goethe (referring to the classics concept): "Ancient works are classical not because they are old but because they are powerful fresh and healthy"<ref>

The concept of the classic was a theme of TS Eliots literary criticism as well In The Sacred Wood (TS Eliot)
Literary figures from different eras have also weighed in on the matter Alan Bennett the modern English playwright and author said that "Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have read themselves" Mark Van Doren the Columbia University professor and poet is quoted by Jim Trelease (in his librarymonograph Classic Picture Books All Children Should Experience) as saying that "A classic is any book that stays in print" And in his "Disappearance of Literature" speech given in 1900 Mark Twain said (referring to a learned academics lofty opinion of Miltons Paradise Lost) that the work met the Professors definition of a classic as "something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read"

In 1920 Fannie M Clark a teacher at the Rozelle School in East Cleveland Ohio predates Calvinos similar conclusions by 60 years when she also essayed the question of what makes a book a "classic" in her article "Teaching Children to Choose" in The English Journal Over the course of her essay Clark considers the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of "the classics" is important to society as a whole Clark says that "teachers of English have been so long trained in the classics that these classics have become to them very much like the Bible for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears" She goes on to say that among the sources she consulted was a group of eighthgraders when she asked them the question: "What do you understand by the classics in literature?" Two of the answers Clark received were "Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children" and "Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college" Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states "Schools and universities ought to help us understand that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite"  Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it classic that in just the act of analysis or as Clark says "the anatomical dissection" the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold

Classics are often defined in terms of their lasting freshness Clifton Fadiman thought that the works that become classic books have their start in childhood saying that "If you wish to live long in the memory of men you should not write for them at all You should write what their children will enjoy" In his view the works we now judge to be classics are "great starters" Fadiman unites classic books through the ages in a continuum (and concurs with Goethes thoughts on the vigour and relevance of the ancient Classics) when he states that classic books share a "quality of beginningness" with the legendary writer of the Iliad and the Odyssey – Homer himself  Ezra Pound in his own tome on reading ABC of Reading gave his opinion when he stated "A classic is classic not because it conforms to certain structural rule or fits certain definitions (of which its author had quite probably never heard)  It is classic because of a certain eternal and irrepressible freshness" Michael Dirda the 1993 Pulitzer Prize winning critic concurred with Pounds view regarding the vitality of a classic when he wrote that "one of the true elements of a classic" was that "they can be read again and again with everdeepening pleasure"

In the 1980s Italo Calvino said in his essay "Why Read the Classics?" that "a classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say" and comes to the crux of personal choice in this matter when he says (italics in the original translation): " classic author is the one you cannot feel indifferent to who helps you define yourself in relation to him even in dispute with him"<ref>citation

</ref> Consideration of what makes a literary work a classic is for Calvino ultimately a personal choice and constructing a universal definition of what constitutes a Classic Book seems to him to be an impossibility since as Calvino says "There is nothing for it but for all of us to invent our own ideal libraries of classics"

While blogging on the website guardiancouk in 2009 Chris Cox echoes Twains "classic" sentiments of 1900 and Bennetts witticism about classic books when he opined on the GuardianCo "Books Blog" that there are actually two kinds of "classic novels": <blockquote>The first are those we know we should have read but probably have not These are generally the books that make us burn with shame when they come up in conversation The second kind meanwhile are those books that weve read five times can quote from on any occasion and annoyingly push on to other people with the words: "You have to read this Its a classic"</blockquote>

 University programs 
"Classic Books" reading lists are used at some universities These "Reading Lists" have remained significant in the 21st century with more of them being created during the past few decades (eg Jane Mallisons Book Smart: Your Essential Reading List for Becoming a Literary Genius in 365 Days (2007))

In 1920 John Erskine (educator)
Core Curriculum (Columbia College)
In addition a handful of colleges offer a major whose pedagogy is structured around the Great Books The University of Notre Dames Program of Liberal Studies established in 1950 and housed in the College of Liberals Arts the Integral Program at Saint Marys College of California (1955) and the Bachelor of Humanities program offered by the College of the Humanities at Carleton University in Ottawa (1995) are three such examples 

Despite the prevalence of Great Books style courses and majors at a number of universities there are only a few colleges that teach their curriculum exclusively through the Great Books model  The first and most well known of these schools is St Johns College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)Great Books program
 Book series 

Thomas Jefferson frequently composed great books lists for his friends and correspondents for example for Peter Carr in 1785 and again in 1787

Publishing
Penguin Books the parent company of Penguin Classics had its inception during the 1930s when the founder Allen Lane was unable to find a book he actually wanted to read while at Exeter train station  As the company website tells it "appalled by the selection on offer Lane decided that good quality contemporary fiction should be made available at an attractive price and sold not just in traditional bookshops but also in railway stations tobacconists and chain stores<ref name  pingu>cite web
</ref> We believed in the existence in this country of a vast reading public and staked everything on it" Within the first year they had sold three million paperbacks of thencontemporary authors such as Agatha Christie Ernest Hemingway and Andre Maurois

In 1954 Mortimer Adler hosted a live weekly television series in San Francisco comprising 52 halfhour programs entitled The Great Ideas These programs were produced by Adlers Institute for Philosophical Research and were carried as a public service by the American Broadcasting Company presented by National Educational Television the precursor to what is now PBS Adler bequeathed these films to the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas where they are available for purchase

In 1993 and 1994 The Learning Channel created The Learning Channels Great Books
