It is caused by infestation with the nematode Parafilaria bovicola  Transmission involves fly Vector (epidemiology)
The disease has been reported in Bulgaria France Germany Morocco Sweden Tunisia and especially South Africa

In Germany the nodules are known to develop on the upper side on the body In Morocco the haemorrhagic lesions are mainly seen on the belly neck and forelimbs where it can lead to a wide plages of subcutaneous necrosis with swelling of the arm

Ivermectin is efficient for individual treatments of the illness But surgical excision although very haemorrhagic is far more efficient

A similar disease sometimes referred to as Cascado occurs in Asia (Indonesia Malaysia) and is caused by Stephanofilaria species

 Epidemiology 
Epidemiology differs among the countries in which it has been reported and is dependent upon temperature and rainfall patterns and the subsequent multiplication of the fly vectors

In Germany the verminous nodules start in May and June 2 to 4 weeks after the beginning of pasture feeding They heal spontaneously in October and November&nbsp; 

In Morocco the disease is observed in years when heavy rainfalls occur in March and April Numerous cases are then observed in April and May in the immediate surroundings of the ponds Some cases will heal spontaneously but some others lead to wide subcutaneous lesions which require a veterinary treatment The repartition and gravity of the skin lesions suggests that the causative agent may be slightly different from the one observed in Western Europe&nbsp;
