Fantasy tropes are a specific type of Trope (literature)
Good vs evil
The conflict of good against evil is a theme in the many popular forms of fantasy; normally evil characters invade and disrupt the good characters lands J R R Tolkien delved into the nature of good and evil in The Lord of the Rings but many of those who followed him use the conflict as a plot device and often do not distinguish the sides by their behavior In some works most notably in sword and sorcery evil is not opposed by the unambiguously good but by the morally unreliable

Hero

Heroic characters are a mainstay of fantasy particularly high fantasy and sword and sorcery Such characters are capable of more than ordinary behavior physically morally or both Sometimes they might have to grow into the role ordained for them This may take the form of maturation which is often through Bildungsroman
Many protagonists are unknown to themselves of royal descent
Dark Lord

The forces of evil are often personified in a "Dark Lord" Besides possessing vast magical abilities a Dark Lord often controls great armies and can be portrayed as possessing devillike qualities A Dark Lord is usually depicted as the ultimate personification of evil

In the Lone Wolf (gamebooks)
Quest

Quests an immemorial trope in literature are common in fantasy They can be anything from a quest to locate the MacGuffins necessary to save the world to an internal quest of selfrealization

Magic

In fantasy magic often has an overwhelming presence although its precise nature is delineated in the book in which it appears It can appear in a fantasy world (as in The Lord of the Rings or Shannara) or in a fantasy land that is part of reality but insulated from the mundane lands (as in Xanth) or as a hidden element in real life (as in The Dresden Files)

A common trope is that magical ability is innate and rare As such magicwielding people are common figures in fantasy Another feature is the Magic in fiction
Selffulfilling prophecyLiterature media and the arts
In The Lord of the Rings J R R Tolkien minimized the use of the word magic; beings who use such abilities tend to be confused when they are described this way by others

Science fantasy stories often make use of scientifically implausible powers similar to magic such as psychics However unlike true science fiction works these powers are used in a Pulp magazine
Medievalism

Many fantasy creatures are inspired by European folklore and the Romance (heroic literature)
This trope is also very important in the setting of many of these fantasies Writers from the beginnings of the fantasy genre such as William Morris in The Well at the Worlds End and Lord Dunsany in The King of Elflands Daughter set their tales in fantasy worlds clearly derived from medieval sources; though often filtered through Medievalism
The full width of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon Governments for instance tend to be feudalistic corrupt empires despite the greater variety of the actual Middle Ages Settings also tend to be medieval in economy with many fantasy worlds disproportionately pastoral

These settings are typical of epic fantasy and to a lesser extent of sword and sorcery — which contains more urban settings — than of fantasy in general; the preponderance of epic fantasy in the genre has made them fantasy commonplaces They are less typical of contemporary fantasy especially urban fantasy

Ancient world
A less common inspiration is the ancient world A famous example is the Hyborian Age (the fictional world of Conan the Barbarian) which features analogues of Ancient Egypt Mesopotamia and the Roman Empire among others Three notable recent series with such settings are: Bartimaeus (book series)
