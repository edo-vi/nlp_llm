The Goguryeo controversies are disputes between China and Korea (North Korea
 Overview 

In 2002 the Northeast Project conducted by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) claimed Goguryeo as a local Ethnic minorities in China
Various analyses of the controversy have focused on external motivations for the reevaluation of history including Korean irredentism towards adjacent Chinese territory the possibility of North Korean collapse and the challenge to China from Ethnic separatism
History of the dispute

Background
<! Speculation on how nationalist historiographical frames such as Zhonghua minzu contributed to the development are treated in a separate section dedicated to that This is purely for describing the facts of how the scholarship unfolded >
As neighboring areas northeast China and North Korea have both laid claim to the history of ancient kingdoms that occupied the region The interpretation of history in this region has implications for contemporary territorial sovereignty During this time the Chinese position was in part motivated by its good relationship with one of its key allies North Korea arguing that the kingdoms capital for 460 out of 706 years lay in modern northeast China and that threequarters of its population were not Koreans
2002–03
Another faction of historians led by Sun Jinji ( Sūn Jìnjǐ) and Zhang Bibo ( Zhāng Bìbō) of the Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences criticized Tan and put forth the thesis that Goguryeo should be regarded as a regional subset of Chinese history ("local Chinese history") rather than purely Korean history They cited the traditional view in Chinese historiography that Korea was founded by the Chinese prince Jizi as well as Goguryeos status as a List of tributaries of Imperial China
The establishment of the Northeast Project of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
China states that Goguryeo was an ethnic Tungusic peoples
In 2003 China applied with UNESCO to register the Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom within its territory as a World Heritage Site In December the South Korean government published a report denying that Goguryeo could be considered part of Chinese history and giving directions to Korean civil society groups on how to counter Chinese claims Korean nationalismcite web

However the CASSs Center for Borderland History and Geography Research is underfunded understaffed (containing only 21 researchers) and not selfsufficient; government subsidies came in response to the extremely low salaries in CASSs history and philosophy departments in contrast to the more lucrative fields of economics and law and the money given does not match the high strategic value of borderland research Historically the CASS has produced research that disagreed with or is critical of government policies

Other still more moderate voices in Korea pointed out that several official publications in China refer to Goguryeo simply as Koreas history Chinese scholars who disagreed with Sun and Zhangs "Chinese local history" view were interviewed by South Korean newspapers<ref>cite news
        </ref> The negative press coverage over the Goguryeo issues increased the incidence of Sinophobia in South Korea<ref>cite news

2004–2007
In March 2004 the South Korean government established the Goguryeo Research Foundation to publish research conducive to its view of Goguryeo as part of Korean history In April Chinas Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Peoples Republic of China            </ref>

However Chinas expressed concerns that Korean irredentism towards northeast China were not addressed by the South Korean side In September the South Korean government declared that the 1909 Gando Convention
In 2006 South Korean president Roh Moohyun protested this research at the 2006 Asia–Europe Meeting That year his government renamed the Goguryeo Research Foundation to the Northeast Asian History Foundation expanding its mandate In 2007 the Northeast Project concluded but neither China nor South Korea has changed their view of Goguryeo history after the dispute In China the diplomatic imbroglio meant that research on Goguryeo has become taboo and former Chinese Goguryeo researchers have diverted their time and resources to other areas

Japanese and North Korean views
During the 19th and 20th centuries the Empire of Japan 
Meanwhile North Korea has glorified Goguryeos independent qualities as part of their Juche ("selfreliance") ideology identifying itself with Goguryeo while equating South Korea with Silla and the United States with the Tang DynastyCite journal
             
</ref> North Koreas state run media has denounced Chinese claims as “a pathetic attempt to manipulate history for its own interests” or “intentionally distorting historical facts through biased perspectives” in North Korean media

Speculative motives
Much of the scholarship on the Goguryeo controversy has focused on Chinas strategic intentions towards the Koreas and presumptively overlooked the validity of Chinese scholars historical claims

Yonson Ahn a Korean scholar who has studied Korean comfort women and historical debates in Korea and Japan writes that historians such as Quan Zhezhu Sun Jinji Kim Huikyo and Mark Byington "perceive the launching of the Project as a defensive reaction to preserve Chinas own territorial integrity and stability"

Modern Chinese nationalism which in contrast to Korean ethnic nationalism
On the other hand some Chinese scholars perceive the Korean nationalism
On the whole the Goguryeo controversy is more significant to Koreans than Chinese Reasons for this imbalance include the fact that in modern Korean nationalism Goguryeos history is presented as a contrast to Korean history in the 19th and 20th century during which Korea was subjugated during Korea under Japanese rule after which it became the first major battleground during the Cold War Another founding tenet of Korean nationalism is to establish independence from China which it had long been subordinate to as a member of the Tributary system of China For example in the 20th century Koreans switched the central figure in their founding myth from Jizi a Chinese human sage to Dangun a god

Li Yangfan a researcher of international relations studies at Peking University believes that South Korean historical sensationalism caused by the turbulent modern history of Korea was the driving force behind the conflict Li views that South Korean historians push for a strong selective narrative in Korean history and that the motive for rejecting Goguryeos Chinese connections is to establish a narrative of a continuous Korean nationstate from Dangun Joseon to Goryeo and modern Korea As both China and South Korea are in the process of nationbuilding Li believes that recognizing South Koreas changes and establishing a set of compatible historiographical views are necessary for Chinas relations with South Korea

Gari Ledyard observed that Goguryeo is also regarded as an important part of Northeast China
 Arguments for Goguryeo as a part of Chinese history 
Chinese scholars are divided on the issue concerning the historical place of Goguryeo As early as the 1940s Jin Yufu (金毓黻) a prominent scholar in Northeast Chinese history asserted that Buyeo
Other Chinese historians see Goguryeo as a part of Korean history In many contemporary Chinese publications on Chinas international relations for example the relations between Chinese dynasties and Goguryeo are treated as foreign relations or SinoKorean relations

 Arguments regarding the history of Goguryeo 
 Goguryeo grew out of the Xuantu Commandery of the Han dynasty The Goguryeo state was founded in presentday Huanren County Liaoning province and expanded to large swathes of Northeast China through a series of conquest wars against neighboring states 
 Goguryeos capital was located in Northeast China from 37 BC to 427 AD which accounted for around two thirds of Goguryeos history Pyongyang was Goguryeos capital only for the last one third of its history
 Goguryeo was under the jurisdiction of the Xuantu Commandery for a more than a century after its establishment The Records of Three Kingdoms recorded that during the Han dynasty the magistrate of Gaogouli County (Goguryeo County) managed household registers of Goguryeo and Xuantu Commandery regularly granted Goguryeo ceremonial instruments and clothing Xuantu was moved further north in the early 2nd century leaving Goguryeo outside its boundaries However the Book of Later Han the Records of Three Kingdoms and the Samguk sagi all recorded the king of Goguryeo requesting to be placed under the jurisdiction of Xuantu or Liaodong commanderies on several occasions from 111 to 169 AD
 Goguryeo had a long and stable tributary relationship with Imperial Chinese dynasties after the 4th century Goguryeo kings actively sought and accepted a tributary status with Chinese dynasties From 32 BC to 666 AD Goguryeo paid 205 tributes to the Chinese Central Plains dynasties From 32 BC to 391 AD Goguryeo paid only 17 tributes but between 423 AD and 666 AD 188 tributes were paid Subordinance rather than independence was the norm in Goguryeos relations with the Chinese Empire Furthermore Goguryeo rulers accepted both recognition of royal titles and assignment of government posts in central or local Chinese governments which shows a Goguryeo selfrecognition as a Chinese power and distinguishes it from foreign tributaries such as Joseon and Vietnam

Arguments regarding the succession of Goguryeo
 The Goguryeo people originated in Northeast China As it expanded Goguryeo absorbed other ethnic groups in the same area The Goguryeo were likely descended from a branch of the Yemaek people The majority of Goguryeos land and population are now within China making China the main successor of Goguryeo After the states collapse the Tang dynasty established the Protectorate General to Pacify the East and resettlee approximately between 28200 and 38200 Goguryeo households among 690000 (up to half of the total population according to some estimates) in the protectorate to the Chinese hinterland according to official Chinese records and Korean sources The Mohe people were ancestors of the Jurchens and Manchus while Mongolicspeaking peoples lived within the Turkic Khaganate Thus Goguryeo no longer exists as an ethnic group but their descendants can be found among the Han Chinese Manchus and Mongols in China The Goguryeo state cannot be viewed as a predecessor of Goryeo (918–1392) nor was it a successor of Gojoseon There was a 250yearlong gap between the fall of Goguryeo and the founding of Goryeo Goryeo only controlled a small proportion of Goguryeo territory Although many Chinese scholars from the Song dynasty onward conflated the two states this was the result of Chinese unfamiliarity with later developments in Korean history as the Song was separated from Korea by the Khitans and Jurchens Similarly there was no succession between the contemporary Former Yan and the Yan (state) Goryeo adopted its name as it was established through a mutiny in the shortlived Later Goguryeo regime However it consciously distanced itself from Goguryeo immediately after unifying the peninsula  On the contrary Goryeo derived its legitimacy from both its unification with Silla and the royal familys Silla bloodline from King Hyeonjong of Goryeo onward Goryeo people frequently compared their kingdom to Samhan or Gojoseon but comparisons to Goguryeo were almost nonexistent — in one occasion rebels against the ruling dynasty styled themselves Goguryeo; in the other Goryeo used its name to justify territorial claims in negotiations during the GoryeoKhitan War
 Furthermore Goryeoera historical texts such as the Samguk sagi viewed Goguryeo negatively as the enemy of Silla and rebellious to Tang while Koreans deified and worshipped Xue Rengui and Su Dingfang Tang generals that led the war against Goguryeo and Baekje Goryeo briefly found it useful to invoke the memory of Goguryeo during Mongol invasions of Korea Territorial and population overlap between Gojoseon and early Goguryeo was minimal Gojoseons land corresponded to the Lelang Commandery of Han dynasty as opposed to Goguryeos founding location within the Xuantu Commandery Tracing Goguryeos cultural legacy is difficult because many perceived legacies of Goguryeo in fact originated from the significant Imperial Chinese and Silla influences on the state  Nonetheless Goguryeo literature music and dance had become part of Sui and Tang culture The majority of List of Goguryeo fortresses in China Based on records of population and migration in historical Chinese and Korean sources Sun Jinji estimated that around a quarter of the Goguryeo population remained in the Korean Peninsula after Goguryeos collapse or moved there thereafter Excluding nonGoguryeoic subject peoples of the state ethnicGoguryeo people were estimated to number more than one million Their descendants thus make up around 1% of Chinas population and around 4% of Koreas Sun calls on researchers to see the mutual inheritance of Goguryeo only as an attestment to China and Koreas longstanding relationship as "brother nations" rather than a pretext to ignite disputes or lay claim to contemporary territories

 Goguryeo as a part of both Chinese and Korean history 
Many Chinese historians do not consider Goguryeos positions in Chinese history and Korean history to be mutually exclusive was proposed by Chinese historical geographer Tan Qixiang in the 1980s In 427 AD Goguryeo moved its capital to Pyongyang and its political and economic center shifted to the Korean Peninsula Therefore Tan divided Goguryeo history into two phases: it is considered a regional Chinese power until 427 and a foreign state after moving its capital Jiang Mengshan suggested that Goguryeo was simultaneously part of Chinese and Korean history He compared Goguryeo to the Yuan dynasty which is important to the history of both Mongolia and China

Critics of Tans view criticize that the division was not based in historical reality of the time Zhang Bibo argues that Pyongyang part of Han dynastys Lelang Commandery was within the territories of Han Wei and Jin dynasties until its conquest by Goguryeo Prior to the Han conquest of Gojoseon
 Arguments for Goguryeo as a part of Korean history 
Korean historians generally make these arguments:

 Arguments regarding the history of Goguryeo 
Goguryeo is a country founded by Buyeo kingdom
 Korean scholars believe that the people of the Three Kingdoms of Korea shared a common ancestor; the YemaekModern Koreans are direct descendants of the Yemaek tribes that originally come from outside the boundaries of Samhan (Manchuria) ie Goguryeo while the Korean language is suggested to be descended from the Goguryeo language Along with its other counterparts Silla and Baekje Goguryeo was traditionally considered as one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea since ancient times and was perceived as a state considered to be one of the predecessors of the Korean nation by both Koreans during the Later Silla and Goryeo Dynasties as well as by the Chinese during the Tang Dynasty and onwards Hence the inclusion of its history in historical records such as Samguk sagi Although supporters of the concept that Goguryeo is Chinese argue that many Goguryeo peoples were deported to China (appx 2820038200 out of 690000 postwar households by official historical records/Korean sources and 78000 by Chinese scholar Wang Zhenping) this arguably enhances the case that Goguryeo is Korean rather than Chinese Whereas the victorious Tang Dynasty had to forcefully deport tens of thousands of Goguryeo civilians to China many surviving Goguryeo remnants outright resisted Tang Chinas Protectorate to Pacify the East Most Goguryeo remnants either rebelled and formed Balhae alongside the Mohe people or fled to Silla It is attested multiple times in Korean and Chinese historical records that Goguryeo and Baekje remnants sided with Silla their longtime enemy and resisted Tang Chinas attempts to conquer the rest of the Korean Peninsula during the SillaTang War For example the Goguryeo Pretender King Anseung who was the nephew or illegitiamte son of the last Goguryeo King rebelled against Tang rule which failed He fled to Silla leading 4000 households with him and the Sillan King bestowed upon him titles of nobility and territory to rule as a vassal The idea that the migrants of Goguryeo voluntarily took refuge in Silla (and were rewarded) indicated that something was very different from the way they were forcibly relocated into China by the Tang In Silla there were also the former territories of  Goguryeo and its residents from areas such as Kaesong a Goguryeo Stronghold Sillas dual contradictory policy towards Goguryeo can arguably be explained as that of a benevolent conqueror including the defeated Baekje and Goguryeo peoples as a part of a unified Samhan identity while at the same time treating them as secondclass members of Silla similar to how in many modern states certain regional identities are prioritized with Prestige Dialects and prestige identities while lesser regional identities are still accepted within a common identity albeit with far less recognition and respect This explains why the Goguryeo peoples maintained a collective identity despite two centuries of Sillan rule and also explains why Goryeo ultimately did decide to mercifully spare the last remnants of Silla at the end of the Later Three Kingdoms Period
 Tang Chinas brutal treatment of the fallen Goguryeo Empire also explains why the Protectorate General to Pacify the East failed to last even a century (668756/761)  and was forced to relocate its capital five times during its existence  Records indicate that Goguryeo rebels launched uprisings every year from 670 to 673 and numerous efforts to restore Goguryeo and expel the Tang were made by the last King of Goguryeo Bojang of Goguryeo his nephew or illegitimate son Anseung Goguryeo General Geom Mojam the Kingdom of Silla (which was waging war against its former patronally over control of former Goguryeo and Baekje territories) and finally the founders of Balhae Dae Jungsang and Dae Joyeong
 Goguryeo lasted about 700 years while no Chinese dynasty concurrent with Goguryeos rule lasted for more than 500 years It was Late Imperial ChinaLegacy of names Joseon ("Gojoseon") is considered the first Korean kingdom After the collapse of Goguryeo the Tang emperor gave to the last ruler of Goguryeo Bojang of Goguryeo the title "King of Joseon" named after the original Joseon kingdom showing that the Chinese themselves considered Goguryeo and Joseon the same lineage Goguryeo was succeeded by Goryeo ("Later Goguryeo") which was succeeded again by "Joseon" 
 The view that Goguryeo is Chinese contradicts with Chinese history records of the past Chinese dynasties which considered it a part of the cultural East Asian cultural sphere Goryeo was founded by Taejo of Goryeo The Samguk Sagi was written by Kim Busik who was an important Korean historian from the Goryeo Dynasty However it cannot be ignored that Kim Busik was a member of the Gyeongju Kim clan which were the direct descendants of the last king of Silla Gyeongsun of Silla Korean historians have noted that Kim extensively focuses on Sillas history during the Three Kingdoms Period and relegates much less attention to both Goguryeo and Baekje The proConfucian sentiment and favorable bias to Silla and Tang found in the Samguk Sagi was due in large part to the Gyeongju Kim Clans political dominance of Goryeo during the Samguk Sagis compilation

 Arguments regarding the succession of Goguryeo 
Goryeo rebuilt Pyongyang the capital of Goguryeo and made it its second capital by naming it the West Capital (Korean languageGoguryeo was also succeeded by Balhae After being conquered by the Liao dynasty the last crown prince of Balhae Dae GwanghyeonTaejo of Goryeo viewed Balhae as a state constituted by his own kind the Goguryeo people and referred to them as relatives According to the Zizhi TongjianSupporting the previous argument although Goryeo arose 250 years after the fall of Goguryeo discrimination from the ruling Sillan people particularly through its Bonerank System kept Goguryeo identity alive The Baekje and Goguryeo refugees retained their respective collective consciousnesses and maintained a deepseated resentment and hostility toward Silla these states are called Later Baekje and TaebongLike Wang Geon regional warlords and residents situated in todays Pyongan ProvinceA major portion of the existing Kim clans that place their roots in Silla royalty and nobility are also said to be descended from the Wang (Korean name)One of the reasons behind Goryeos Jurchen Expeditions (1104~1109) was to reclaim former Goguryeo territories According to the Biographies of Yun Gwan<nowiki/> written in the Goryeosa the head of the commander whom spearheaded the invasions Yun Gwan quoted after claiming Jurchenheld territories "These lands were originally owned by Goguryeo The text of the old monument still remains How would this not be the will of the heavens for our King (Yejong of Goryeo) has acquired what Goguryeo had lost before? (而本勾高麗之所有也 其古碑遺跡 尙有存焉 夫勾高麗失之於前 今上得之於後 豈非天歟) Diplomatic feuds between the Korean Goryeo Dynasty and Jurchen Jin Dynasty continued despite peace agreements after Goryeos failed attempt to conquer Jurchen territories in which two major military campaigns had mobilized at least 250000 troops from Goryeo alone The Jurchens who won the war with a heavy cost with their lands devastated by the Koreans would later conquer the Northern Song Dynasty under Agudas leadership However Goryeo during the reign of Yejong did not tolerate Agudas selfproclamation as Emperor after his empires ascension following the defeat of the Song Dynasty seeing them nothing more than former vassals and servants of their Goguryeo ancestors and that of themselves until the advent of Wuyashu<ref>고려사 (Records of Goryeo 1451)

 Arguments regarding recognition from foreign dynasties 

China Japan and other foreign states during medieval times acknowledged the legitimate succession by Korean dynasties such as Goryeo and Joseon of Goguryeo and viewed them as its rightful successors Such is evidenced in records and scripts

 During diplomatic talks on the onset of the Goryeo–Khitan WarXu Jing (徐兢 1091–1153) of the Northern Song Dynasty makes it clear that Goryeo was the continuation and equivalent of Goguryeo through his texts written in the Gaolitujing (高麗圖經) He illustrates the history of the Royal Family of Goryeo and states that the people refounded their nation once again after the decline of their predecessors
 Chinese historical texts particularly the dynastic historical records of Chinese Dynasties repeatedly describe Goguryeo as a part of Korean history rather than Chinese history and confirm the succession of Goguryeo by Goryeo For example in the Yuanshi Ming Chinese historians describe the succession of Goguryeo by Later Goguryeo and Goryeo as follows: "The Kings family name was Ko His country fell during the Ganfeng era of tha Tang After the Chuigong era his descendants received titles and gradually became independent In the Five Dynasties (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period) they moved the country to Songak and raised a King whose family name is Wang and first name is Geon" Another example is the Mingshi where Qing Chinese historians describe the succession of Goguryeo by Goryeo and subsequent unification of the Later Three Kingdoms as follows: "Ko from the Buyeo people founded a country in the land at the end of the Han Dynasty and named it Goryeo or Goguryeo and lived in Pyeongyangbut was later defeated and forced to move east During the Later Tang Wang Geon succeeded Go absorbed Silla and Baekje and moved the capital to Songak"
Kublai Khan regarded Goryeo as the same country as Goguryeo By the end of the Mongol invasions of Korea Kublai was in the middle of a power struggle with Ariq Böke whom was residing in Karakorum while Kublai himself was participating in the Mongol conquest of China The Japanese saying "The Mongol ("Mukuri") and Goguryeo ("Kokuri") demons are coming! (むくりこくり)" has its origins back during the time of the Mongol invasions of Japan Choe Bu of Joseon in 1488 who was stranded in Ming China was asked by a Ming government official "What special skills does your country have that it was able to defeat the Sui and Tang dynasties armies?" Choe Bu replied "Goguryeo had strategic experts and powerful generals who were skilled in military and had soldiers who served their superiors to the death Therefore Goguryeo is a small country but defeated the Tianxias one million soldiers two times Now Silla Baekje and Goguryeo have become one country we have abundant products and large land riches and powerful military and immeasurable numbers of loyal and wise scholars"

 Ties with modern day Korea 

Goguryeo traditions such as ondol Korean fortress Kimchi Bulgogi fermented foods (eg doenjang jeotgal etc as mentioned in Records of the Three Kingdoms) onggi etc are central mainstays of Korean culture The ondol a traditional heating technology was first built and practiced by the Goguryeo people Chinese records indicate the first ondols existing in Goguryeo Goryeo has strong claims as the cultural successor of Goguryeo because it was during the Goryeo dynasty that Ondol technology spread across the entire Korean Peninsula This is in strong contrast with Sillan rule over the Korean Peninsula which lasted more than two hundred years yet did not lead to the popularization of Ondol which did happen during Goryeo Modern Koreans continue this tradition with the dol bed or stone bed a manufactured bed that has the same heating effect as ondol  The dol bed industry is estimated to be worth 100 billion Korean won comprising 30 to 40 percent of the entire bed industry in South Korea
Martial arts such as Korean Wrestling (Ssireum) traditional dancing musical instruments (eg Janggu Geomungo) clothing (eg Hanbok Gat (hat) The word "Korea"  comes from the word Goryeo one of successor states of Goguryeo The term Goryeo itself is the shortened form of Goguryeo first used during the era of King Jangsu of Goguryeo in the 5th century AD It has become a term to refer to the Korean people later on after Unified SillaModern Korean is said to have its origins on the Kaesong dialect which later became the standard in Middle Korean after its spread throughout the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasties It was initially spoken in central Korea by the native Goguryeo populace situated there when Kaesong was the capital of Goryeo 
The affinity for dancing and singing amongst the commoners is a shared trait that continued on to later Korean dynasties

Perspectives by outsiders

Alexander Vovin believes Gorguyeo was Koreanic in origin He pointed to Koreanic loanwords in Jurchen language
According to John B Duncan of UCLA: "For the last 1000 years Goguryeo was an important factor in helping modern Korea find its identity Goguryeo is part of Korean history"

According to Mark Byington of Harvard University who has followed the debate since 1993 Goguryeo "was clearly not a Chinese state in any sense as demonstrated abundantly by Chinas own dynastic histories" Byington says that the Chinese position is "historically indefensible" and "historically flawed" but at the same time has valid reasons politically (eg territorial concerns) and is not as "sinister" as many Koreans believe (ie "a prelude to an active aggression against Korea")

Finnish linguist Juha Janhunen believes that it was likely that a "Tungusic languages
According to scholar Andrei Lankov: "There is no doubt that the presentday dispute represents a case of retroprojection of modern identities The reallife Koguryoans would have been surprised or even offended to learn that in the future they would be perceived by Koreans as members of the same community as their bitter enemies from Silla Describing Koguryo as Chinese or Korean is as misleading as say describing medieval Brittany as French or English or Irish"

 Validity of claims on ancient history 
Some scholars analyze empirical evidence through the lens of nationalism and ethnocentrism Yonson Ahn and JieHyun Lim believe that projecting modern concepts of national territory and identity onto ancient nation states is selfserving

Yonson says that the Chinese claims on Goguryeo history tend to be centered on territory: because Goguryeo and Balhae shared territories with modernday China it is therefore Chinese Korean arguments tend to stem from ancestry a common bloodline Yonson argues both philosophies contradict the exclusivity claim that many scholars try to make for either Korea or China because Goguryeo possessed territories that now are within the borders of North Korea as well as China and descendants of Goguryeo people live in both Korea and China She also argues that the strong distinction between "self" and "other" drives many scholars to accept only exclusive possession of history and its artifacts Disputes over such claims are often laden with terms like "stealing"

 Recent developments 
The Chinese city of Jian has built a Goguryeo museum within walking distance of the Yalu River One of the major Goguryeo steles is displayed there

Professor JoonYoung Kang at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies noted that Chinas interpretation of Koguryo history completely reversed South Koreas positive view on China visàvis the United States From 1992 until 2015 South Korea and China experienced a surge in positive relations as each abandoned their traditional Cold War ally (Taiwan and North Korea) and engaged in greater economic cultural and technological ties This was further empowered by the two nations mutual grievances towards Japan due to the atrocities committed by the Empire of Japan during the Second World War which often led to them jointly filing protests alongside North Korea towards Japan on topics such as the Rape of Nanking and Comfort Women However according to HanWool Jung vicedirector of the Center for Public Opinion Analysis of the East Asia Institute the Northeast Project annihilated Chinas diplomatic accomplishments in South Korea with a stroke

On the celebration of the 30th anniversary of KoreaChina ties the National Museum of China presented a chronology of Ancient Korean history which only included information about kingdoms like Baekje (18 BC660 AD) and Silla (57 BC935 AD) which were located on the southern and central parts of the Korean Peninsula while omitting Goguryeo and Balhae whose main territories belonged to the current North Korea and some parts of Manchuria the current Chinese territory This sparked diplomatic protests and demands of apology from the Republic of Korea which accused the National Museum of China of tampering the chronology that Korea had initially given to China

This is raising speculation that Beijing is reactivating its "Northeast Project" that was launched by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2002
