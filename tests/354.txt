Provenance in geology is the reconstruction of the origin of sediments The Earth is a dynamic planet and all rocks are subject to transition between the three main rock types: Sedimentary rock
In the modern geological lexicon "sediment provenance" specifically refers to the application of compositional analyses to determine the origin of sediments This is often used in conjunction with the study of exhumation histories interpretation of drainage networks and their evolution and forwardmodelling of paleoearth systems In combination these help to characterise the "source to sink" journey of clastic sediments from hinterland (geology)
 Introduction 

Provenance (from the French provenir "to come from") is the place of origin or earliest known history of something In geology (specifically in sedimentary petrology) the term provenance deals with the question where sediments originate from The purpose of sedimentary provenance studies is to reconstruct and to interpret the history of sediment from parent rocks at a source area to detritus at a burial place The ultimate goal of provenance studies is to investigate the characteristics of a source area by analyzing the composition and texture of sediments The studies of provenance involve the following aspects: "(1) the source(s) of the particles that make up the rocks (2) the erosion and transport mechanisms that moved the particles from source areas to depositional sites (3) the depositional setting and depositional processes responsible for sedimentation of the particles (the depositional environment) and (4) the physical and chemical conditions of the burial environment and diagenetic changes that occur in siliciclastic sediment during burial and uplift" Provenance studies are conducted to investigate many scientific questions for example the growth history of continental crust collision time of Indian and Asian plates Asian monsoon intensity and Himalayan exhumation Meanwhile the provenance methods are widely used in the oil and gas industry "Relations between provenance and basin are important for hydrocarbon exploration because sand frameworks of contrasting detrital compositions respond differently to diagenesis and thus display different trends of porosity reduction with depth of burial"

 Source of detritus 
All rock exposed at the Earths surface is subjected to physical or chemical weathering and broken down into finer grained sediment All three types of rocks (igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rocks) can be the source of detritus

 Transportation of detritus 
File:Distribution of detrituspngRocks are transported downstream from higher elevation to lower elevation Source rocks and detritus are transported by gravity water wind or glacial movement The transportation process breaks rocks into smaller particles by physical abrasion from big boulder size into sand or even clay size At the same time minerals within the sediment can also be changed chemically Only minerals that are more resistant to chemical weathering can survive (eg ultrastable minerals zircon tourmaline and rutile) During the transportation minerals can be sorted by their density and as a result light minerals like quartz and mica can be moved faster and further than heavy minerals (like zircon and tourmaline)

 Accumulation of detritus 

After a certain distance of transportation detritus reaches a sedimentary basin and accumulates in one place With the accumulation of sediments sediments are buried to a deeper level and go through diagenesis which turns separate sediments into sedimentary rocks (ie Conglomerate (geology)

 Reworking of detritus 
After detritus are eroded from source area they are transported and deposited in river foreland basin or flood plain Then the detritus can be eroded and transported again when flooding or other kinds of eroding events occur This process is called as reworking of detritus And this process could be problematic to provenance studies For example UPb Detrital zircon geochronology
 Development of provenance methods 
The study of sedimentary provenance involves several geological disciplines including mineralogy geochemistry geochronology sedimentology igneous and metamorphic petrology The development of provenance methods are heavily dependent on the development of these mainstream geological disciplines The earliest provenance studies were primarily based on paleocurrent analysis and petrographic analysis (composition and texture of sandstone and conglomerate) Since the 1970s provenance studies shifted to interpret tectonic settings (ie magmatic arcs collision orogens and continental blocks) using sandstone composition<ref name  "Dickinson 1979">cite journal

 Provenance methods 

Generally provenance methods can be sorted into two categories which are petrological methods and geochemical methods Examples of petrological methods include QFL ternary diagram heavy mineral assemblages (apatite–tourmaline index garnet zircon index) clay mineral assemblages and illite crystallinity reworked fossils and palynomorphs and stock magnetic properties Examples of geochemical methods include zircon UPb dating (plus Hafnium

 Examples of provenance methods 

 Sandstone composition and plate tectonics 

This method is widely used in provenance studies and it has the ability to link sandstone composition to tectonic setting This method is described in the Dickinson and Suczek 1979 paper Detrital framework modes of sandstone suites from different kinds of basins are a function of provenance types governed by plate tectonics (1)Quartzose sandstone
 Resolving provenance problems by dating detrital minerals 
File:An example of U–Pb relative age probability diagrampngGeochronology and thermochronology are more and more applied to solve provenance and tectonic problems Detrital minerals used in this method include zircons monazites white micas and apatites The age dated from these minerals indicate timing of crystallization and multiple tectonothermal events This method is based on the following considerations: "(1) the source areas are characterized by rocks with different tectonic histories recorded by distinctive crystallization and cooling ages; (2) the source rocks contain the selected mineral;"  (3) Detrital mineral like zircon is ultrastable which means it is capable of surviving multiple phases of physical and chemical weathering erosion and deposition This property make these detrital mineral ideal to record long history of crystallization of tectonically complex source area

 Lab data acquisition and instruments 
File:SHRIP IIJPGTo pick suitable lab data acquisition to sediment provenance grain size should be taken into consideration For conglomerates and boulders as original mineral paragenesis is preserved almost all analytical methods can be used to study the provenance For finer grained sediments as they always lose paragenetic information only a limited range of analytical methods can be used

Lab data acquisition approaches for provenance study fall into the following three categories: (1) analyzing bulk composition to extract petrographic mineralogical and chemical information (2) analyzing specific groups of minerals such as heavy minerals and (3) analyzing single mineral grains about morphological chemical and isotopic properties

For bulk composition analysis samples are crushed powdered and disintegrated or melted Then measurement of major and trace and rareearth (REE) elements are conducted by using instruments like atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) Xray fluorescence(XRF) neutron activation analysis (NAA) etc

Sandsized sediments are able to be analyzed by singlegrain methods Singlegrain methods can be divided into the following three groups: (1) Microscopicmorphological techniques which are used to observe shape color and internal structures in minerals For example scanning electron microscope (SEM) and cathodoluminescence (CL) detector (2) Single grain geochemical techniques which are used to acquire chemical composition and variations within minerals For example ICPMS
 Problems and limitations of provenance studies 
File:Source to basinpngDuring the pathway of detritus transported from source area to basin the detritus is subject to weathering transporting mixing deposition diagenesis and recycling The complicated process can modify parents lithology both compositionally and textually All these factors pose certain limits on our capability to restore the characteristics of source rocks from the properties of the produced detrital record The following paragraphs briefly introduce major problems and limitations of provenance studies

 Candidate source area 
To correlate sediments (detrital record) to source area several possible source area need to be chosen for comparison In this process possible source area where sediment is from may be missed and not chosen as a candidate source area This could cause misinterpretation in correlation sediment to source later

 Grain size 
Grain size could cause misinterpretation of provenance studies During transportation and deposition detritus is subject to mechanical breakdown chemical alternation and sorting This always results in a preferential enrichment of specific materials in a certain range of grainsize and sediment composition tends to be a function of grain size For instance SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratios decrease with decreasing of grain size because Alrich phyllosilicate enriches at the expense of Sirich phase in finegrained detritus This means the changing of composition of detrital record could reflect effect of sorting of grain size and not only changing of provenance To minimize the influence of sedimentary sorting on provenance method (like SrNd isotopic method) only very finegrained to finegrained sandstones are collected as samples but mediumgrained sandstones can be used when alternatives are unavailable

 Mixing of detritus 
Mixing of detritus from multiple sources may cause problems with correlating the final detrital record to source rocks especially when dispersal pathways are complex and involve recycling of previously deposited sediments For example if a detrital record contains zircon grains with an age of one billion years that were transported by rivers flowing through two source areas containing zircons which are also one billion years old it would not be possible to determine which of the two upstream source areas was the source of the zircon detritus based on age alone

 Diagenesis 
Diagenesis could be a problem when analyzing detrital records especially when dealing with ancient sediments which are always lithified

 Hinterland structural assumption 
File:Structural assumptionpngAs a provenance study tries to correlate detrital record (which is stored in basins) to hinterland stratigraphy and hinterland stratigraphy is structurally controlled by fault systems so hinterland structural setting is important to interpretation of the detrital record Hinterland structural setting is estimated by field mapping work Geologists work along river valleys and traverse mountain belts (thrust belt) locate major faults and describe major stratigraphy bounded by faults in the area A geologic map is the product of field mapping work and cross sections can be constructed by interpreting a geologic map However a lot of assumptions are made during this process so the hinterland structural settings are always assumptions And these assumptions can affect interpretation of detrital record Here is an example the right figure shows a classic thrust belt and foreland basin system the thrust fault carries overlying rocks to the surface and rocks of various lithology are eroded and transported to deposit at the foreland basin In structural assumption 1 the pink layer is assumed to exist above thrust 2 and thrust 3 but in the 2nd assumption the pink layer is only carried by thrust 2 Detrital records are stored in foreland basin stratigraphy Within the stratigraphy the pink layer is correlated to the hinterland pink layer If we use structural assumption 2 we can interpret that thrust 2 was active about 12 and 5 million years ago But when using the other assumption we couldnt know if the pink layer record indicates activity of thrust 2 or 3

 Sediment provenance studies in hydrocarbon exploration and production 
A combination usage of multiple provenance methods (egpetrography heavy mineral analysis mineral geochemistry wholerock geochemistry geochronology and drainage capture analysis)can provide valuable insights to all stages of hydrocarbon exploration and production In exploration stage provenance studies can enhance the understanding of reservoir distribution and reservoir quality These will affect chance of success of exploration project; In development stage mineralogical and chemical techniques are widely used to estimate reservoir zonation and correlation of stratigraphy At the same time these provenance techniques are also used in production stage For example they are used to assess permeability variations and well decline rate resulting from spatial variability in diagenesis and depositional facies
