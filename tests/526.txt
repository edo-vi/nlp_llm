Verisimilitude () is the "lifelikeness" or believability of a fiction
Original roots

Verisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of mimesis the imitation or representation of nature For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience according to Plato and Aristotle it must have grounding in reality

This idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the Middle Ages particularly in Italian heroic poetry During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be through verisimilitude poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle decorum: the realistic union of style and subject Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age gender or race of the character

This classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art The goal of the novel therefore as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader The novel had to facilitate the readers willingness Suspension of disbelief
Continued evolution

The idea that credibility and in turn verisimilitude rested on the readers sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction 

As more criticism on the novel surfaced the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader French theorist Pierre Nicolas Desmolets notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts but rather as a work as a whole The novel was a total illusion of life within itself It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novels credibility then could be seen in terms of the novels own internal logic 

The focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader The focus shifted to the novel itself Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novels fictional world Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot

Postmodern perspective

During the rise of the Postmodern literature
The reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction The novel should challenge the construction of reality In this sense it was possible for art to precede reality Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation In the postmodern context verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics

Application of the concept in the arts
In the production of the classic superhero film Superman (1978 film)
