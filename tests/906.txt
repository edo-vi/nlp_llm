Biology is the science
Biologists are able to study life at multiple Biological organisation
Life on Earth which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago is immensely diverse. Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life from prokaryote
History


File:Hooke-bluefly.jpg
The earliest of roots of science which included medicine can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 Common Era
Biology began to quickly develop with Anton van Leeuwenhoeks dramatic improvement of the microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa bacteria infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop techniques of microscopic dissection and staining. Advances in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell (biology)
Meanwhile taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic Taxonomy (biology)
File:Charles Darwin aged 51.jpg
Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck who presented a coherent theory of evolution. The British naturalist Charles Darwin combining the biogeographical approach of Alexander von Humboldt
The basis for modern genetics began with the work of Gregor Mendel in 1865. This outlined the principles of biological inheritance. However the significance of his work was not realized until the early 20th century when evolution became a unified theory as the Modern synthesis (20th century)
Chemical basis
Atoms and molecules


All organisms are made up of chemical elements; oxygen carbon hydrogen and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms with calcium phosphorus sulfur sodium chlorine and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder. Different elements can combine to form chemical compound
Water
File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.svg

Life arose from the Earths first ocean which formed some 3.8 billion years ago. Since then water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution
Organic compounds


File:Glucose Haworth.png
Organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen. Carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms enabling it to form diverse large and complex molecules. For example a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane two Double bond
The simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon which is a large family of organic compounds that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other elements such as oxygen (O) hydrogen (H) phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) which can change the chemical behavior of that compound. Groups of atoms that contain these elements (O- H- P- and S-) and are bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton are called functional groups. There are six prominent functional groups that can be found in organisms: Amine
In 1953 the Miller-Urey experiment showed that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically within a closed system mimicking the conditions of early Earth thus suggesting that complex organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously in early Earth (see abiogenesis).

Macromolecules


File:225 Peptide Bond-01.jpg
Macromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or monomers. Monomers include sugars amino acids and nucleotides. Carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars.
Lipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. They include steroids phospholipids and fats
Proteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules. They include enzymes transport proteins large cell signalNucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides. Their function is to store transmit and express hereditary information.

Cells


Cell theory states that Cell (biology)
Cell structure

File:biological cell.svg
Every cell is enclosed within a cell membrane that separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular space. A cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their Membrane fluidity
File:Plant cell structure-en.svg
Within the cytoplasm of a cell there are many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to biomolecules eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called organelles that have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units. These organelles include the cell nucleus which contains most of the cells DNA or mitochondrion
Metabolism


File:Activation2 updated.svg
All cells require energy to sustain cellular processes. Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions in an organism. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of metabolic wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce maintain their structures and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic—the breaking down of compounds (for example the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or anabolic—the building up (biosynthesis
Cellular respiration


Image:CellRespiration.svg
Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert EnergyEnergy and life
Sugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is called aerobic respiration which has four stages: glycolysis citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle) electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two pyruvic acid
If oxygen were not present pyruvate would not be metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm where it is converted to cellular waste product
Photosynthesis

File:Simple photosynthesis overview.svg


Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to Energy transformation
Photosynthesis has four stages: Light absorption electron transport ATP synthesis and carbon fixation. Light absorption is the initial step of photosynthesis whereby light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments attached to proteins in the ThylakoidMembrane
During the third stage of photosynthesis the movement of protons down their concentration gradients from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma through the ATP synthase is coupled to the synthesis of ATP by that same ATP synthase.

Cell signaling



Cell signaling (or communication) is the ability of Cell (biology)
Cell cycle

File:Meiosis Overview new.svg


The cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell (biology)
Prokaryotes (i.e. archaea and bacteria) can also undergo cell division (or binary fission). Unlike the processes of mitosis and meiosis in eukaryotes binary fission takes in prokaryotes takes place without the formation of a spindle apparatus on the cell. Before binary fission DNA in the bacterium is tightly coiled. After it has uncoiled and duplicated it is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases the size to prepare for splitting. Growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium (triggered by FtsZ polymerization and "Z-ring" formation) The new cell wall (Septum (cell biology)
Genetics

Inheritance



File:Punnett square mendel flowers.svg
Genetics is the scientific study of inheritance. Mendelian inheritance specifically is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring. A Punnett square can be used to predict the results of a test cross. The Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory
Genes and DNA

File:DNA animation.gif

A gene is a unit of heredity that corresponds to a region of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that carries genetic information that controls form or function of an organism. DNA is composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a Nucleic acid double helixDNA replication is a Semiconservative replicationSome mutations are beneficial as they are a source of genetic variation for evolution. Others are harmful if they were to result in a loss of function of genes needed for survival. Mutagens such as carcinogens are typically avoided as a matter of health policy
Gene expression

File:Extended Central Dogma with Enzymes.jpg


Gene expression is the molecular process by which a genotype encoded in DNA gives rise to an observable phenotype in the proteins of an organisms body. This process is summarized by the central dogma of molecular biology which was formulated by Francis Crick in 1958. According to the Central Dogma genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. There are two gene expression processes: transcription (genetics)

Evolutionary processes



File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg
Evolution is a central organizing concept in biology. It is the change in Heredity

Speciation


A species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other. For speciation to occur there has to be reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model. Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with genetic divergence. Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species a process known as allopatric speciation.

Phylogeny




A phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes. It can be represented using a phylogenetic tree a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes. Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a Lineage (evolution)
History of life
<!---->


The history of life on Earth traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on Earth both living and extinct descended from a last universal common ancestor that lived about Timeline of evolution
The similarities among all known present-day species indicate that they have diverged through the process of evolution from their common ancestor. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as evidence of universal common descent for all bacterium
Algae-like multicellular land plants are dated back even to about 1 billion years ago although evidence suggests that microorganisms formed the earliest terrestrial ecosystems at least 2.7 billion years ago. Microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the Ordovician period. Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the Late Devonian extinction

Bacteria and Archaea



File:Gemmatimonas aurantiaca.jpg
Bacteria are a type of Cell (biology)
File:Halobacteria.jpg
Archaea constitute the other domain of prokaryotic cells and were initially Taxonomy (biology)
The first observed archaea were extremophiles living in extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes with no other organisms. Improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every habitat including soil oceans and marshlands. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet.

Archaea are a major part of Life
Eukaryotes



File:Euglena diagram.jpg
Eukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea which was followed by their Endosymbiont
Plants are mainly multicellular organisms predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the Kingdom (biology)
Fungus
Animals are multicellular eukaryotes. With few exceptions animals Heterotroph
Viruses



File:Phage.jpg
Viruses are wikt:submicroscopic
The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolution
Ecology



Ecology is the study of the distribution and abundance of life the interaction between organisms and their natural environment
Ecosystems



The community (ecology)
Populations



File:Logistic Carrying Capacity.svg
A population is the group of organisms of the same species that occupies an geographical area
Communities



File:TrophicWeb.jpg
A community is a group of populations of species occupying the same geographical area at the same time. A biological interaction is the effect that a pair of organisms living together in a community have on each other. They can be either of the same species (intraspecific interactions) or of different species (interspecific interactions). These effects may be short-term like pollination and predation or long-term; both often strongly influence the evolution of the species involved. A long-term interaction is called a symbiosis. Symbioses range from Mutualism (biology)On average the total amount of energy incorporated into the biomass of a trophic level per unit of time is about one-tenth of the energy of the trophic level that it consumes. Waste and dead material used by decomposers as well as heat lost from metabolism make up the other ninety percent of energy that is not consumed by the next trophic level.

Biosphere



File:Carbon cycle.jpg
In the global ecosystem or biosphere matter exists as different interacting compartments which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible depending on their forms and locations. For example matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible. A biogeochemical cycle is a pathway by which specific chemical element
Conservation



Conservation biology is the study of the conservation of Earths biodiversity with the aim of protecting species their habitats and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions. It is concerned with factors that influence the maintenance loss and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetics
