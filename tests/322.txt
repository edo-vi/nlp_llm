File:Revised figure.jpgFour Core Genotypes (FCG) mice are laboratory mice produced by genetic engineering that allow biomedical researchers to determine if a sex difference in phenotype is caused by effects of gonadal  Sex hormone
Development

The FCG model was created by Paul Burgoyne and Robin Lovell-Badge at the National Institute for Medical Research London (now Francis Crick Institute). The model involves deleting the testis-determining gene SRY
Significance

The FCG model has been used to discover that the XX and XY animals respond differently in models of human physiology and disease including autoimmunity metabolism cardiovascular disease cancer Alzheimers disease
