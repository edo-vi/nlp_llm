MTVs Buzz Bin was a select group of music videos by up and coming artists and bands that the network deemed "buzz worthy" "wikt:cutting edge
The Buzz Bin began in 1987 and featured artists and bands from all genres of music (not just alternative rock or modern rock acts although those were the majority) Many music industry trade publications have noted the direct effect Buzz Bin selection has had on album sales with some sources stating that upwards of 75% of the selected acts have gone on to achieve RIAA Gold Certification or better In 1992 The New York Times noted the Buzz Bin labels power in increasing sales and creating hit songs and Entertainment Weekly called it "Alternative rocks best friend"

In an article published in the journal of Music and Science Osborn Rossin and Weingarten conducted a thorough content analysis of 288 Buzz Clips videos to "assess the kinds of people and cultural practices MTV promoted as buzzworthy in the 1990s" The study found high degrees of correlation between gender ethnicity instrumentation and genre: BIPOC musicians videos were often coded as hiphop or R&B featuring drum machines and keyboards; white musicians videos featured more electric guitars; and women were shown playing instruments with less frequency than men

The Buzz Bin ended in 2004 and was split in half into MTVs "Discover and Download" and VH1s "You Oughta Know"

MTV released two compilation CDs of Buzz Bin tracks on Mammoth Records
