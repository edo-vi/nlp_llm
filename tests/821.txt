File:Vilem Flusser 1940jpgVilém Flusser (May 12 1920&nbsp;– November 27 1991) was a Brazilian Czechs
His early work was marked by discussion of the thought of Martin Heidegger and by the influence of existentialism and Phenomenology (philosophy)
 Life 
Flusser was born in 1920 in Prague Czechoslovakia into a family of Jewish intellectuals His father Gustav Flusser studied mathematics and physics (under Albert Einstein among others) Flusser attended German and Czech primary schools and later a German grammar school

In 1938 Flusser started to study philosophy at the Juridical Faculty of the Charles University in Prague In 1939 shortly after the Nazi Germany
In 1960 he started to collaborate with the Brazilian Institute for Philosophy (IBF) in São Paulo and published in the Revista Brasileira de Filosofia; by these means he seriously approached the Brazilian intellectual community Flusser had as his friend and closest interlocutor the Brazilian philosopher Vicente Ferreira da Silva Flusser and Vicente Ferreira da Silva met in São Paulo in the 1960s and began a close intellectual dialogue that continued until Ferreira da Silvas death in 1963 Flusser wrote several essays on Ferreira da Silvas work and that Ferreira da Silvas concept of "Fundamental ontology” had a significant impact on Flussers understanding of the nature of reality During the 60s Flusser published and taught at several schools in São Paulo being Lecturer for Philosophy of Science at the Escola Politécnica of the University of São Paulo and Professor of Philosophy of Communication at the Escola Dramática and the Escola Superior de Cinema in São Paulo He also participated actively in the arts collaborating with the Bienal de São Paulo among other cultural events

Beginning in the 1950s he taught philosophy and worked as a journalist before publishing his first book Língua e realidade (Language and Reality) in 1963 In 1972 he decided to leave Brazil Some say it was because it was becoming difficult to publish because of the military regime Others dispute this reason since his work on communication and language did not threaten the military In 1970 when a reform took place at the University of São Paulo by the Brazilian military government all Lecturers of Philosophy (members of the Department of Philosophy) were dismissed Flusser who taught at the Engineering School (Escola Politécnica) had to leave the university as well In 1972 he and his wife Edith settled temporarily in Merano (Tyrol) Further short stays in various European countries followed until they moved to Robion in southern France in 1981 where they remained until Flussers death in 1991 To the end of his life he was quite active writing and giving lectures around media theory and working with new topics (Philosophy of Photography Technical Images etc) He died in 1991 in a car accident near the Czech–German border while trying to visit his native city Prague to give a lecture

Vilém Flusser is the cousin of David Flusser

 Philosophy 
Flussers essays are short provocative and lucid with a resemblance to the style of journalistic articles Critics have noted he is less a systematic thinker than a dialogic one purposefully eclectic and provocative (Cubitt 2004) However his early books written in the 1960s primarily in Portuguese language
Flussers writings relate to each other however which means that he intensively works over certain topics and dissects them into a number of brief essays His main topics of interest were: epistemology ethics aesthetics ontology language philosophy semiotics philosophy of science the history of Western culture the philosophy of religion the history of symbolic language technology writing the technical image photography migration media and literature and especially in his later years the philosophy of communication and of artistic production

His writings reflect his wandering life: although the majority of his work was written in German and Portuguese language
Flussers archives have been held by the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne and are currently housed at the Berlin University of the Arts

 Philosophy of photography 
Writing about photography in the 1970s and 80s in the face of the early worldwide impact of computer technologies Flusser argued that the photograph was the first in a number of technical image forms to have fundamentally changed the way in which the world is seen Historically the importance of photography had been that it introduced nothing less than a new epoch: The invention of photography constitutes a break in history that can only be understood in comparison to that other historical break constituted by the invention of linear writing

Whereas ideas might previously have been interpreted in terms of their written form photography heralded new forms of perceptual experience and knowledge As Flusser Archive Supervisor Claudia Becker describes "For Flusser photography is not only a reproductive imaging technology it is a dominant cultural technique through which reality is constituted and understood" In this context Flusser argued that photographs have to be understood in strict separation from pretechnical image forms For example he contrasted them to paintings which he described as images that can be sensibly decoded because the viewer is able to interpret what he or she sees as more or less direct signs of what the painter intended By contrast even though photography produces images that seem to be faithful reproductions of objects and events they cannot be so directly decoded The crux of this difference stems for Flusser from the fact that photographs are produced through the operations of an apparatus And the photographic apparatus operates in ways that are not immediately known or shaped by its operator For example he described the act of photographing as follows:



Roughly put the person using a camera might think that they are operating its controls to produce a picture that shows the world the way they want it to be seen but it is the preprogrammed character of the camera that sets the parameters of this act and it is the apparatus that shapes the meaning of the resulting image Given the central role of photography to almost all aspects of contemporary life the programmed character of the photographic apparatus shapes the experience of looking at and interpreting photographs as well as most of the cultural contexts in which we do so 
 
Flusser developed a lexicon of terms that have proven influential and that continue to be useful for thinking about contemporary photography digital imaging technologies and their online uses These include: the apparatus (a tool that changes the meaning of the world in contrast to what he calls mechanical tools that work to change the world itself); the functionary (the photographer or operator of the camera who is bound by the rules it sets); the programme (a system in which chance becomes necessity and a game in which every virtuality even the least probable will be realized of necessity if the game is played for a sufficiently long time); the technical image (the first example of which is the photograph with its particular kind of significant surface that looks like a traditional image but harbours encoded and obscure concepts that cannot be immediately deciphered) While Flusser did write a number of short essays on the work of specific photographers his major focus was the critical and philosophical need to understand late 20thcentury media culture and the emergent possibilities and threats presented by the larger forces at work in an increasingly technical and automated world Flussers Vampyroteuthis Infernalis has also been interpreted as a fable about photography

Concept of Home and Homelessness

Flusser was deeply influenced by the loss of his native Prague and his relocations throughout his life which can be seen in his writings and causing him to proclaim his homelessness "because there are so many homelands that make their home in me" His personal biography was particularly helpful for his studies in interpersonal communication and how to facilitate it Communication which are the gaps between different positions is part of a cultural phenomenon relying on unconsciously learnt patterns at home Language therein is a major influence on ones thinking Flusser asked what are the consequences of the loss of ones home and traditional connections? He differentiated between the two meanings of home originating in the German language "Heimat" understood as a homeland and "Wohnung" understood as in house and argued that home cannot be understood as an eternal value transcending time and space A person is bound to its "Heimat" through invisible threads such as connections to people tradition and language which all lay beyond the consciousness Only when a person is removed from their home they become aware of the ties which reveal themselves as unconscious judgements These unconscious "habits prevent bits of information from being perceived" and make the habitual environment comfortable and therefore pretty For Flusser this substantiates the "love for a fatherland"

The homeless person must not only consciously learn the habits of a new home but also must forget them again as if they become conscious these habits reveal themselves as banal threatening to expose the true nature of the home of the natives The developing polemic dialog distinguishes between the "ugly stranger" who can unveil the truth (Aletheia) and the "beautiful native" who fears the otherness as it threatens their habit Flusser used his experience in Brazil during a time of massive immigration to demonstrate the possibility to set oneself free of the unconscious habits of the homeland to form new voluntary connections which lead up to the creation of a new homeland

However opposed to the homeland one can free himself off the home understood as in house is a necessary part of human existence It gives a person the mental ability to process information as it divides the sphere of existence into habit or home and unusual or new information The habitual environment is a prerequisite to recognize the unusual which comes into ones home Flusser refers in this regard to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
