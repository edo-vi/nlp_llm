A prologue or prolog (from Ancient Greek
Latin
File:Prologue IjpgImage:Every Man in his Humour title page 1616jpgOn the Latin stage the prologue was often more elaborate than it was in Athens and in the careful composition of the poems which Plautus prefixes to his plays we see what importance he gave to this portion of the entertainment; sometimes as in the preface to the Rudens Plautus rises to the height of his genius in his adroit and romantic prologues usually placed in the mouths of persons who make no appearance in the play itself

Molière revived the Plautian prologue in the introduction to his Amphitryon (Molière)
The tradition of the ancients vividly affected our own early dramatists Not only was the mystery plays and miracles of the Middle Ages begun by a homily but when the drama in its modern sense was inaugurated in the reign of Elizabeth the prologue came with it directly adapted from the practice of Euripides and Terence Thomas Sackville 1st Earl of Dorset

Prologues of Renaissance drama often served a specific function of transition and clarification for the audience A direct address made by one actor the prologue acted as an appeal to the audiences attention and sympathy providing historical context a guide to themes of the play and occasionally a disclaimer  In this mode a prologue like any scripted performance would exist as the text the actor who speaks that text and the presentation of the language as it is spoken In ushering the audience from reality into the world of the play the prologue straddles boundaries between audience actors characters playwrights—basically it creates a distinction between the imaginary space within the play and the outside world Ben Jonson has often been noted as using the prologue to remind the audience of the complexities between themselves and all aspects of the performance

The actor reciting the prologue would appear dressed in black a stark contrast to the elaborate costumes used during the play The prologue removed his hat and wore no makeup He may have carried a book scroll or placard displaying the title of the play He was introduced by three short trumpet calls on the third of which he entered and took a position downstage He made three bows in the current fashion of the court and then addressed the audience
The Elizabethan prologue was unique in incorporating aspects of both classical and medieval traditions In the classical tradition the prologue conformed to one of four subgenres: the sustatikos which recommends either the play or the poet; the epitimetikos in which a curse is given against a rival or thanks given to the audience; dramatikos in which the plot of the play is explained; and mixtos which contains all of these things In the medieval tradition expressions of morality and modesty are seen as well as a metatheatrical selfconsciousness and an unabashed awareness of the financial contract engaged upon by paid actors and playwrights and a paying audience

Use in fiction
Prologues have long been used in nondramatic fiction since at least the time of Geoffrey Chaucers Canterbury Tales although Chaucer had prologues to many of the tales rather than one at the front of the book

The Museum of Eternas Novel by the Argentine writer Macedonio Fernandez has over 50 prologues by the author Their style varies between metaphysical humoristic psychological discussions about the art of the novel etc
