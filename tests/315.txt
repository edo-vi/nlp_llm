There were several risk factors associated with the outbreak described by the WHO including intermittent supplies in Harare particularly in highdensity suburbs such as Glenview the epicenter of the outbreak The city council was also unable to supply enough water for Harare creating shortages due to the increasing urban population

These shortages led to sanitation issues as people began to use unregulated wells and boreholes leading people in Harare drinking contaminated water

To address the water supply issues in key hotspots affected by cholera through increasing water supply through water trucking adding water tanks and repairing existing water infrastructure To address sanitation issues items such as soap and chlorination tablets were distributed to households in hotspot areas
