Lymphocystis is a common virus
Aquarists often come across this virus when their fish are stressed such as when put into a new environment and the virus is able to grow

The fish start growing small white pinprick like growths on their fins or skin and this is often mistaken for infection by Ichthyophthirius multifiliis in the early stages It soon clumps together to form a cauliflowerlike growth on the skin mouth fins and occasionally the gills 

This virus appears to present itself as lesions at differing locations depending on the species of fish being attacked often complicating initial diagnosis Lesions at the base of the dorsal fin are common among freshwater species of Central American origin most notably Herichthys carpintis; inside the mouth of Herichthys cyanoguttatus and Geophagus steindachneri; on the tail fin of koi carp and US native sunfish (Lepomis spp); on the side flanks of walleye sauger and flounder; on head or tail areas of common goldfish and oranda variants

Lymphocystis does show some hostspecificity ie each strain (or species) of lymphocystis can infect only its primary host fish or some additional closely related fish

There is no known cure for this virus though a privately owned fish research and breeding facility near Gainesville Florida has reportedly been able to suppress the virus into remission using the human antiDNA virus drug acyclovir at the rate of 200&nbsp;mg per 10 US gallons for 2 days Otherwise some aquarists recommend surgery to remove the affected area if it is very serious followed by an antibiotic bath treatment to prevent a secondary bacterial infection of the open wounds

Eventually the growths inhibit the fishs ability to swim breathe or eat and secondary bacterial infections usually kill the fish

Usually the best cure is to simply give the fish a stressfree life a weekly bacteria treatment and the virus will slowly subside and the fins will repair themselves This can take many months Like most viral infections even in humans the first outbreaks are the most serious whilst the immune system "learns" how to suppress it the outbreaks become less severe over time assuming the organism survives the initial outbreaks
