The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in the Philippines began in July 1979 And in 1986 made a response to the Universal Child Immunization goal The four major strategies include:
 sustaining high routine Full Immunized Child (FIC) coverage of at least 90% in all provinces and cities;
 sustaining the poliofree country for global certification;
 eliminating measles by 2008; and
 eliminating neonatal tetanus by 2008

Routine Schedule of Immunization
Every Wednesday is designated as immunization day and is adopted in all parts of the country  Immunization is done monthly in barangay health stations quarterly in remote areas of the country

Routine Immunization Schedule for Infants
The standard routine immunization schedule for infants in the Philippines is adopted to provide maximum immunity against the seven vaccine preventable diseases in the country before the childs first birthday The fully immunized child must have completed BCG 1 DPT 1 DPT 2 DPT 3 OPV 1 OPV 2 OPV 3 HB 1 HB 2 HB 3 and measles vaccines before the child is 12 months of age

General Principles in Infants/Children Immunization
 Because measles kills every infant needs to be vaccinated against measles at the age of 9 months or as soon as possible after 9 months as part of the routine infant vaccination schedule  It is safe to vaccinate a sick child who is suffering from a minor illness (cough cold diarrhea fever or malnutrition) or who has already been vaccinated against measles
 If the vaccination schedule is interrupted it is not necessary to restart Instead the schedule should be resumed using minimal intervals between doses to catch up as quickly as possible
  Vaccine combinations (few exceptions) antibiotics lowdose steroids (less than 20&nbsp;mg per day) minor infections with low fever (below 385ยบ Celsius) diarrhea malnutrition kidney or liver disease heart or lung disease nonprogressive encephalopathy well controlled epilepsy or advanced age are not contraindications to vaccination Contrary to what the majority of doctors may think vaccines against hepatitis B and tetanus can be applied in any period of the pregnancy
 There are very few true contraindication and precaution conditions Only two of these conditions are generally considered to be permanent: severe (anaphylactic) allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose of a vaccine and encephalopathy not due to another identifiable cause occurring within 7 days of pertussis vaccination
 Only the diluent supplied by the manufacturer should be used to reconstitute a freezedried vaccine A sterile needle and sterile syringe must be used for each vial for adding the diluent to the powder in a single vial or ampoule of freezedried vaccine
 The only way to be completely safe from exposure to bloodborne diseases from injections particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV) hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is to use one sterile needle one sterile syringe for each child

Tetanus Toxoid Immunization Schedule for Women
When given to women of childbearing age vaccines that contain tetanus toxoid (TT or Td) not only protect women against tetanus but also prevent neonatal tetanus in their newborn infants
! Vaccine
! Minimum <br />Age/Interval
! Percent<br />Protected
! Duration of Protection
 protection for the mother for the first delivery
 infants born to the mother will be protected from neonatal tetanus
 gives 3 years protection for the mother
 infants born to the mother will be protected from neonatal tetanus
 gives 5 years protection for the mother
 infants born to the mother will be protected from neonatal tetanus
 gives 10 years protection for the mother
 gives lifetime  protection for the mother
 all infants born to that mother will be protected
In June 2000  the 57 countries that have not yet achieved elimination of neonatal tetanus were ranked and the Philippines was listed together with 22 other countries in Class A a classification for countries close to maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination

Care for the Vaccines
To ensure the optimal potency of vaccinesa careful attention is needed in handling practices at the country level These include storage and transport of vaccines from the primary vaccine store down to the enduser at the health facility and further down at the outreach sites  Inappropriate storage handling and transport of vaccines wont protect patients and may lead to needless vaccine wastage

A "first expiry and first out" (FEFO) vaccine system is practiced to assure that all vaccines are utilized before its expiry date  Proper arrangement of vaccines and/or labeling of expiry dates are done to identify those close to expiring  Vaccine temperature is monitored twice a day (early in the morning and in the afternoon) in all health facilities and plotted to monitor break in the cold chain  Each level of health facilities has cold chain equipment for use in the storage vaccines which included cold room freezer refrigerator transport box vaccine carriers thermometers cold chain monitors ice packs temperature monitoring chart and safety collector boxes
