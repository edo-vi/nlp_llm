Geomathematics (also: mathematical geosciences mathematical geology mathematical geophysics) is the application of mathematical methods to solve problems in geosciences including geology and geophysics and particularly geodynamics and seismology

 Applications 
 Geophysical fluid dynamics 
Geophysical fluid dynamics develops the theory of fluid dynamics for the atmosphere ocean and Earths interior Applications include geodynamics and the theory of the geodynamo

 Geophysical inverse theory 
Geophysical inverse theory is concerned with analyzing geophysical data to get model parameters It is concerned with the question: What can be known about the Earths interior from measurements on the surface? Generally there are limits on what can be known even in the ideal limit of exact data

The goal of inverse theory is to determine the spatial distribution of some variable (for example density or seismic wave velocity) The distribution determines the values of an observable at the surface (for example gravitational acceleration for density) There must be a forward model predicting the surface observations given the distribution of this variable

Applications include geomagnetism magnetotellurics and seismology

 Fractals and complexity 
Many geophysical data sets have spectra that follow a power law meaning that the frequency of an observed magnitude varies as some power of the magnitude An example is the distribution of earthquake magnitudes; small earthquakes are far more common than large earthquakes This is often an indicator that the data sets have an underlying fractal geometry Fractal sets have a number of common features including structure at many scales irregularity and selfsimilarity (they can be split into parts that look much like the whole) The manner in which these sets can be divided determine the Hausdorff dimension of the set which is generally different from the more familiar topological dimension Fractal phenomena are associated with Chaos theory
 Data assimilation 
Data assimilation combines numerical models of geophysical systems with observations that may be irregular in space and time Many of the applications involve geophysical fluid dynamics Fluid dynamic models are governed by a set of partial differential equations For these equations to make good predictions accurate initial conditions are needed However often the initial conditions are not very well known Data assimilation methods allow the models to incorporate later observations to improve the initial conditions Data assimilation plays an increasingly important role in weather forecasting

 Geophysical statistics 
Some statistical problems come under the heading of mathematical geophysics including model validation and quantifying uncertainty
 Terrestrial Tomography 

An important research area that utilises inverse methods is
seismic tomography a technique for imaging the subsurface of the Earth using seismic waves Traditionally seismic waves produced by earthquakes or anthropogenic seismic sources (eg explosives marine air guns) were used

 Crystallography 
Crystallography is one of the traditional areas of geology that use mathematics Crystallographers make use of linear algebra by using the Metric tensor
 Geophysics 
Geophysics is one of the most Mathematics
 Geomorphology 
Many applications of mathematics in geomorphology are related to water In the Soil mechanics Darcys law is used when one has a saturated soil that is uniform to describe how Fluid dynamics Stokes law Stream power is used to find the ability of a river to River incision Differential equations can be used in multiple areas of geomorphology including: The Exponential growth
 Glaciology 
Mathematics in Glaciology consists of theoretical experimental and modeling It usually covers glaciers sea ice Environmental flow
Crystallite
Viscoelasticity
ShallowIce approximation is useful for glaciers that have variable thickness with a small amount of stress and variable velocity One of the main goals of the mathematical work is to be able to predict the stress and velocity Which can be affected by changes in the properties of the ice and temperature This is an area in which the basal shearstress formula can be used
