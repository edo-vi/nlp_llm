Ethmoid hematoma is a progressive and locally destructive disease of horses  It is indicated by a Mass (medicine)
The hematoma usually extends into the nasal passage A growing hematoma causes pressure necrosis of the bone surrounding the hematoma  but only on rare occasions does it cause facial distortion It is most commonly seen in horses older than six years Mild persistent spontaneous intermittent and unilateral epistaxis is the most common sign clinically 

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of the condition is best suited to endoscopy;  the lesion can be seen extending into the nasal passages on endoscopic examination and can be demonstrated on Xray
Treatment
Treatment most commonly involves the removal of the complete lesion during a single procedure via the frontonasal bone flaps; recurrence is likely Ablation treatment with an Nd:YAG laser looks to be a possibility for permanent removal

Some success has been seen using intralesional injections of formalin performed by endoscopy

Prognosis
Prognosis for this condition varies according to extent of the hematoma but is normally fairly good  Smaller hematomas carry a 99% chance of full recovery with larger ones carrying a recovery rate ranging from 80 to 90%  Occasional epistaxis may follow the surgery but this is temporary and should subside within 2 to 3 weeks after surgery
