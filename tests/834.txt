Sifap ("stroke in young Fabry patients") is a PanEuropean study dedicated to investigating the correlation of juvenile stroke and a genetic disorder known as Fabrys disease It was initiated by University of Rostock Germany In recruiting 5000 patients aged 18 to 55 it will be the largest study on stroke in the young Approximately 50 study centres from about 15 European countries are participating in the project The study is divided into two parts: sifap1 and sifap2 Whereas sifap1 analyses the frequency of Fabry disease within the patient cohort sifap2 controls and investigates the rehabilitation phase of diagnosed Fabry patients

Background
The goal of the study is to show that Fabry disease has to be considered to be one of the most frequent genetic causes of juvenile stroke To date the frequency of Fabry disease among general population has been estimated to be around 1:40000 However recent investigations have shown that Fabry disease can occur in 1 of 83 stroke patients aged 18–55 and between 1 of 3500 to 1 of 4500 individuals of the general population Sifap aims at scientifically testing and supporting these findings

Progress
After the proofofprinciple phase (April to December 2007) the official start of the study was January 1 2008 Sifap1 patients were recruited until June 30 2009 Sifap2 runs simultaneously and is scheduled to conclude on June 30 2012

Technique
File:MG 0581ajpgOne of sifap’s unique characteristics is the fully automated analysis and storage of specimens in combination with the complete digital and webbased data handling A pipetting robot extracts DNA from specimens and analyses them for Fabry disease Afterwards specimens are automatically stored in a biobank and consequently are available for future investigations

Committees
In order to control advise and establish professional structures two committees were formed Publication issues and sifap basics are the responsibility of the steering committee The nine members are: Miron Ginsberg (Miami USA) Michael Hennerici (Mannheim Germany) Christof Kessler (Greifswald Germany) Edwin Kolodny (New York USA) Peter Martus (Berlin Germany) Bo Norrving (Lund Sweden) ErichBernd Ringelstein (Münster Germany) Peter Rothwell (Oxford UK) and Graham Vanables (Sheffield UK)
The biobank committee oversees the administration of stored specimens and decides in formal meetings on proposed new projects The biobank committee consists of: Natan Bornstein (Tel Aviv Israel) Peter Paul DeDeyn (Antwerp Belgium) Martin Dichgans (Munich Germany) Franz Fazekas (Graz Austria) Hugh Markus (London UK) Olaf Rieß (Tübingen Germany) and Arndt Rolfs (Rostock Germany) Imaging analysis was centrally performed at the Department of Neurology of the Medical University of Graz coordinated by Franz Fazekas
