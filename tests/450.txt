File:Petrarch by BargillajpgThe Dark Ages is a term for the Early Middle Ages or occasionally the entire Middle Ages in Western Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire that characterises it as marked by economic intellectual and cultural decline

The concept of a "Dark Age" as a historiographical periodization originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar Petrarch who regarded the postRoman centuries as "dark" compared to the "light" of classical antiquity The term employs traditional blackandwhite dualism
As the accomplishments of the era came to be better understood in the 19th and the 20th centuries scholars began restricting the Dark Ages appellation to the Early Middle Ages () and todays scholars also reject its usage for the period The majority of modern scholars avoid the term altogether due to its negative connotations finding it misleading and inaccurate Despite this Petrarchs pejorative meaning remains in use particularly in popular culture which often simplistically views the Middle Ages as a time of violence and backwardness

History



Petrarch
File:TommasoLaureti TriumphofChristianityjpg
The idea of a Dark Age originated with the History of Tuscany
From his perspective on the Italian peninsula Petrarch saw the Roman period and classical antiquity as an expression of greatness He spent much of his time traveling through Europe rediscovering and republishing classic Latin and Greek language
Petrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of Ancient Greece
Reformation
During the Protestant Reformation
Baronius
In response to the Protestantism
! Century !! Volumes !! of
volumes



Significantly Baronius termed the age dark because of the paucity of written records The "lack of writers" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in Jacques Paul Migne
File:European Output of Manuscripts 500–1500png
There is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th The 11th century with 13 evidences a certain recovery and the 12th century with 40 surpasses the 9th something that the 13th with just 26 fails to do There was indeed a dark age in Baroniuss sense of a "lack of writers" between the Carolingian Renaissance in the 9th century and the beginnings sometime in the 11th of what has been called the Renaissance of the 12th century Furthermore there was an earlier period of "lack of writers" during the 7th and 8th centuries Therefore in Western Europe two dark ages can be identified separated by the brilliant but brief Carolingian Renaissance

Baronius dark age seems to have struck historians for it was in the 17th century that the term started to spread to various European languages with his original Latin term  being reserved for the period to which he had applied it Some following Baronius used dark age neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records but others used it pejoratively and lapsed into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians

The first British historian to use the term was most likely Gilbert Burnet in the form darker ages which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century The earliest reference seems to be in the "Epistle Dedicatory" to Volume I of The History of the Reformation of the Church of England of 1679 where he writes: "The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first and to purge it of those corruptions with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages" He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II where he dismisses the story of "St Georges fighting with the dragon" as "a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry" Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant and his use of the term is invariably pejorative

Enlightenment
During the Age of Enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason For them the Middle Ages or "Age of Faith" was therefore the opposite of the Age of EnlightenmentVoltaire Marquis De Sade and JeanJacques Rousseau were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion while Edward Gibbon
Consequently an evolution had occurred in at least three ways Petrarchs original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time implicitly at least Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a dark age their times were still not light enough for 18thcentury writers who saw themselves as living in the real Age of Enlightenment while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call Early Modern times Additionally Petrarchs metaphor of darkness which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievement was sharpened to take on a more explicitly Antireligion
Romanticism
In the late 18th and the early 19th centuries the Romanticism
Just as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light and darkness the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment However the period that they idealized was largely the High Middle Ages extending into Early modern period
Modern scholarly use

The term was widely used by 19thcentury historians In 1860 in The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy Jacob Burckhardt delineated the contrast between the medieval dark ages and the more enlightened Renaissance which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity The earliest entry for a capitalized "Dark Ages" in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is a reference in Henry Thomas Buckles History of Civilization in England in 1857 who wrote: "During these which are rightly called the Dark Ages the clergy were supreme" The OED in 1894 defined an uncapitalised "dark ages" as "a term sometimes applied to the period of the Middle Ages to mark the intellectual darkness characteristic of the time"

However the early 20th century saw a radical reevaluation of the Middle Ages which called into question the terminology of darkness More forcefully a book about the history of German literature published in 2007 describes "the dark ages" as "a popular if uninformed manner of speaking"

Most modern historians do not use the term "dark ages" and prefer terms such as Early Middle Ages However when used by some historians today the term "Dark Ages" is meant to describe the economic political and cultural problems of the era  For others the term Dark Ages is intended to be neutral expressing the idea that the events of the period seem dark to us because of the paucity of the Recorded history
Since the Late Middle Ages significantly overlap with the Renaissance the term Dark Ages became restricted to distinct times and places in medieval Europe Thus the 5th and 6th centuries in Britain in the Middle Ages
However from the later 20th century onward other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term for two main reasons to such an extent that it is no longer really dark to us It was occasionally used up to the 1990s by historians of early medieval Britain for example in the title of the 1991 book by Ann Williams (historian)
Modern nonscholarly use

A 2021 lecture by Howard Williams (archaeologist)
In a book about medievalisms in popular culture by Andrew B R Elliott (2017) he found "by far" the most common use of Dark Ages is to "signify a general sense of backwardness or lack of technological sophistication" in particular noting how it has become entrenched in daily and political discourse  Reasons for use according to Elliott are often "banal medievalisms" which are "characterized mainly by being unconscious unwitting and by having little or no intention to refer to the Middle Ages"; for example referring to an insurance industry that still relied on paper instead of computers as being in the Dark Ages These banal uses are little more than trope (literature)
In Peter S Wellss 2008 book Barbarians to Angels: The Dark Ages Reconsidered he writes "I have tried to show that far from being a period of cultural bleakness and unmitigated violence the centuries (5th  9th) known popularly as the Dark Ages were a time of dynamic development cultural creativity and longdistance networking" He writes that our "popular understanding" of these centuries "depends largely on the picture of barbarian invaders that Edward Gibbon presented more than two hundred years ago" and that this view has been accepted "by many who have read and admire Gibbons work"
