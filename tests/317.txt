Fictional portrayals of psychopaths or sociopaths are some of the most notorious in film and literature but may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of psychopathy which is itself used with varying definitions by mental health professionals criminologists and others The character may be identified as a diagnosed/assessed psychopath or sociopath within the fictional work itself or by its creator when discussing their intentions with the work which might be distinguished from opinions of audiences or critics based only on a character appearing to show traits or behaviors associated with an undefined popular stereotype of psychopathy

Such characters are often portrayed in an exaggeration
19th century
In the 19th century the diagnostic categories of monomania or moral insanity (the word moral then meant either emotional or ethical) made their way into works of literature covering numerous eccentricities obsessions or breakdownsâ€”and sometimes acts of apparently senseless criminality occasionally violent This period also saw the rise of crime fiction such as sensation novels where often someone in a local community who appeared normal would turn out to be criminally insane and detective novels playing on increasing anxieties about the characters of people in the newly expanding and diversifying industrial cities The term psychopath came into use in the late 19th century (as did the term it would often be confused with psychotic) and also spanned a very wide range of conditions (etymologically and originally equivalent to mentally ill) Nevertheless an early rise to prominence followed its use in a Russian trial between 1883 and 1885 concerning a child murder contributing to the release of a probable false confessor while the original suspect was found guilty Psychopaths began to appear in vaudevilles ditties (songs) and press articles The psychopathy defense was reported internationally as having enabled a remorseless female child killer to go free a usage still quoted in dictionaries today

Social degeneration
20th century
Early 20th century
The meaning gradually narrowed initially as psychopathic inferiors covering all of what today might be called personality disorders and various other conditions then intertwining with the terminology of the sociopath (and eventually antisocial personality disorder) though psychopathy remained variously defined in both broad and narrow ways

Early representations of psychopaths in film were often caricatured as sadistic unpredictable sexually depraved and emotionally unstable (mania
One exceptional depiction in this period was the character of child murderer Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) in the 1931 Fritz Lang film M (1931 film)
The Ostap Bender character from novels The Twelve Chairs and The Little Golden Calf by Soviet authors Ilf and Petrov is also considered a portrait of a charming psychopath

Mid 20th century
One of the earliest real life cases which had a pervasive influence on American movies was that of Ed Gein arrested in 1957 A farmer who had resided with his mother until her death he had then killed two women and dug up female bodies from the local cemetery making various items out of their skin Rumours spread that he was also a necrophiliac cannibal or transvestite though these appear to have been unsupported other than by brief affirmations from Gein to leading questions by interrogators Gein was found mentally ill and legally insane before trial deemed to have had schizophrenia (psychosis including delusions and hallucinations) for at least 12 years though at least one media psychiatrist dubbed him instead a sexual psychopath Robert Bloch a prolific pulp horror author says his 1959 novel Psycho (novel)
A different thread within fictional portrayals of psychopathy continued to focus on rebelliously antisocial characters The title of the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause starring James Dean came from a 1944 book of the same name detailing the hypnosis
American mystery author Patricia Highsmith often featured psychopathic characters in her books most notably her Ripliad series about Tom Ripley a "suave agreeable and utterly amoral" con artist and serial killer In the first book 1955s The Talented Mr Ripley Ripley murders a rich man and steals his identity; in four subsequent novels he commits several murders and engages in a longrunning art forgery scam all without getting caught Ripley has been described by several critics as a psychopath while author and diagnosed narcissistic personality disorder
Late 20th century
The 1973 film Badlands (film)
The increasing media focus of serial killers in the late 20th century fueled by cases such as John Wayne Gacy (1978) Ted Bundy (1978) and Jeffrey Dahmer (1991) lent an additional momentum to the way psychopathy was both perceived and portrayed in film and literature sometimes incorporating a hybrid of traditional psychopaths from early film and late19th century literature with the highfunctioning behaviors detected in some serial killers

The psychiatrist and cannibalism
The novel American Psycho tells the story of Patrick Bateman a yuppie serial killer working on Wall Street in the 1980s It was made into a American Psycho (film)
In the 1993 book Girl Interrupted and its 1999 Girl Interrupted (film)
The 1996 film Primal Fear (film)
Harry Potter author J K Rowling has described Lord Voldemort the series main villain as "a raging psychopath devoid of the normal human responses to other peoples suffering and there ARE people like that in the world"

21st century
Numerous characters in television shows are informally described as psychopaths Examples include Natalie Buxton in Bad Girls (TV series)
Tana Frenchs 2007 novel In the Woods depicts two detectives who work to hunt down child murderess Rosalind Devlin Upon discovery it is remarked that Devlin is a psychopath who is incapable of emotional attachment and feigns vulnerability to better manipulate people

Anton Chigurh the primary antagonist of the novel No Country for Old Men (novel)
Gregory House
Sherlock Holmes the lead character in the BBC series Sherlock (TV series)
The Dan Wells (author)
One Chicago academic has argued in a review of TV trends that the contemporary fantasy of sociopathy/psychopathy is of someone whose emotional disconnection from others in society rather than being the hindrance that it can represent in real clinical cases enables them to be an amazingly successful manipulator due to a breakdown in the social contract

Vriska Serket antihero of web fiction epic Homestuck displays numerous traits of psychopathy especially Machiavellianism lack of remorse and fearlessdominant confidence Her friend Karkat Vantas calls her a "vile backstabbing sociopath"

Contemporary advice on writing psychopathic/sociopathic characters suggests that lack of a conscience and lack of empathy are always the chief characteristics along with an ability to fool others while the type of selfish antisocial behavior and any secondary characteristics can vary

In 2013 the video console game Grand Theft Auto V was released with numerous references to psychopaths and sociopaths including reports from a fictional psychiatrist One of the lead characters Trevor is described both psychopathic and psychotic; the voice actor who played the part says he based his performance on Tom Hardys portrayal of Charles Bronson (prisoner)
